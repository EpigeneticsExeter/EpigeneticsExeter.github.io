<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
Molly is a PhD student within the Cancer Genomics group at the University of Exeter under the supervision of Professor Chrissie Thirlwell and Dr Amy Webster. Prior to beginning her PhD, Molly’s undergraduate studies in Biomedical Science at the University of the West of England taught her countless laboratory techniques along with a sound understanding of human disease. During Molly’s undergraduate degree, she completed a placement year in the department of Physiology and Biophysics at Virginia Commonwealth University in the United States which sparked her passion for research. Following her placement year, Molly’s dissertation project investigated the effects of amino acid restriction in a leukemic cell line which highlighted her interest in novel therapeutics and a need for a personalised approach to cancer treatment. Molly’s PhD project is currently investigating the impact of diabetes on cancer biology. Molly works closely with the Complex Disease Epigenetics Group and the Genetics of Complex Traits Group in a collaborative approach to investigate the genetic and epigenetic landscape of colorectal cancer.
