Adam is the laboratory manager for the Dementia Genomics group. He graduated with a BSc in Medical Sciences from the University of Exeter, College of Medicine and Health, in 2014, this was where he found a particular interest in genetics and neurology. Adam spent a year as an associate genetic technician for the Royal Devon and Exeter Genetic NHS service as part of his degree. Since then, Adam has undertaken a PhD under the supervision of Professor Katie Lunnon and Professor Jonathan Mill. This work defined the extent of various epigenetic changes in the ANK1 gene in Alzheimer’s disease, relating this information to both levels of gene expression and characteristic measures of disease stage. He completed his PhD in June 2018 and his first postdoc, within the same team, looked to explore the epigenetic similarities between Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, ending in March 2020. As the group’s laboratory manager, Adam is now involved in the many studies being undertaken by the group, including the epigenetic regulation of mitochondria in Dementia.
