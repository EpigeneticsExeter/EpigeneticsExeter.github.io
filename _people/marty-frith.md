<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
Marty graduated from the University of Exeter with a BSc Honours degree in Medical Sciences with Professional Training Year in 2022. Over the course of his undergraduate studies, Marty cultivated a keen interest in neuroscience with a particular focus on neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.

He undertook his professional training year with the Complex Disease Epigenomics Group at the University of Exeter, during which his work focused on epigenetic variation in schizophrenia. In his final year undergraduate research project, Martyn carried out a Mendelian randomization study using UK Biobank data to examine the causal role of serum lipid levels on schizophrenia outcomes.  

Marty currently works as a graduate research assistant at the Exeter NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (BRC). Here he will be involved in projects that reflect the BRCâ€™s core research themes. He will soon be undertaking a PhD project attempting to develop a novel cell-free DNA liquid biopsy for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease.
