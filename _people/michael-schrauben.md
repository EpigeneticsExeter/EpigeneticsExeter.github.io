Michael is a PhD student at the University of Exeter under the supervision of Professor Katie Lunnon and Dr Emma Dempster. He graduated from Imperial College London with a MRes degree in Cancer Biology and previously obtained a BSc (Hons) degree in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Greenwich. Through projects investigating the role of DNA methylation in ovarian cancer progression and the impact of alternative splicing on miRNA regulation, Michael developed a keen interest in epigenetics and gene editing technology. For his PhD project with the Complex Disease Epigenetics Group, Michael investigates the role of differentially methylated positions associated with Alzheimer's disease in gene regulation via CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools.
