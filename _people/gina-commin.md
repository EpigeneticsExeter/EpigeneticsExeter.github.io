<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
Gina completed a degree in Natural Sciences, specialising in Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, at the University of Cambridge. Following this she spent a few years working in clinical research assisting in the clinical trial management before undertaking an MPhil in Developmental Biology at the University of Cambridge. This was followed by a PhD in the lab of Dr Erica Watson, co-supervised by Prof Anne Ferguson Smith, exploring the potential genetic and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the transgenerational inheritance of developmental abnormalities seen in mice with abnormal folate metabolism.
Her work in the Complex Disease Epigenomics group focuses on using single technologies to explore transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of single cells within human brain. We aim to understand how these may be affected by disease.
