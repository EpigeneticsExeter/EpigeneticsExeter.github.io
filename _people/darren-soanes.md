<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
Darren graduated with a BA in Biochemistry from the University of Oxford in 1991 and then took a PGCE in Secondary Science at the University of Sussex. He spent four years as a Science teacher at a secondary school in Eastbourne before moving to the University of Exeter to study for an MSc in Biological Research Methods. After that he stayed in Exeter and undertook a PhD in the laboratory of Nick Talbot studying the gene expression of the pathogenicity factor MPG1 in the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. He stayed in Nick Talbot’s group as a postdoctoral research fellow where he moved from lab-based research to bioinformatics. Darren acted as bioinformatics support for the group, analysing both transcriptomic and genomic sequence data. He was also involved in a number of other projects, analysing sequence data from species of fungal phytopathogens, as well as providing online resources for the fungal community and contributing functional annotation to a number of fungal and microbial genome sequencing projects. Darren was involved in comparative analysis of genomic data in order to model the evolution of <i>M. orzyae</i> and guide the breeding of plants that have increased resistance to this fungus.In 2018, Darren joined the Exeter Sequencing Service, processing raw sequence data and aiding researchers in their own analyses. Darren joined Katie Lunnon’s group in 2019 where he used micro-RNA and RNA-sequencing of blood samples to investigate inflammatory mechanisms in patients with mild cognitive impairment and to determine if this accelerates conversion to Alzheimer’s Disease. In 2023 Darren joined the NIHR Exeter Biomedical Research Centre as a bioinformatics research fellow. He will be responsible for developing methods for the analysis of large-scale biomedical datasets and be involved in a number of interdisciplinary research projects, primarily within the neurodegeneration theme.
