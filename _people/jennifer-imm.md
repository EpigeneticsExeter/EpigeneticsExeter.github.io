<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
Jenny joined the group in 2015 to undertake her PhD under the supervision of Professor Katie Lunnon. During her PhD she characterised the epigenetic changes that occur in iPSC-neuronal and microglial models when they are exposed to AD-relevant exposures, such as differentiation and maturation, drug treatment and immune challenge. Since completing her PhD she has continued in the group as a research fellow, where she will be continuing the work from her PhD. Alongside this she is also starting a new project looking at the epigenetic changes occurring in dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease and Parkinson’s disease dementia in post-mortem brain samples.
