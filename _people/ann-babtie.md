<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
Ann joined the Complex Disease Epigenomics group in 2023 as a postdoctoral researcher (bioinformatics) focusing on analysing single nuclei transcriptomic data. She is also a Lecturer in Postgraduate Education teaching on Exeter's MSc Genomic Medicine course. She completed a PhD in Biochemistry at Cambridge University in 2010, studying enzyme mechanisms and evolution. Following postdoctoral research at MIT (2011-12) working on microbial metabolic engineering for biofuel production, she transferred from experimental to computational biology research. From 2013-21 she was a researcher at Imperial College London in the Theoretical Systems Biology group, using mathematical and statistical approaches to study the structure and regulation of biological networks. Her research focused on developing methods to analyse single-cell transcriptomic data, and approaches to assess uncertainty in mathematical models of biological systems; this was partly funded by a BBSRC Future Leader Fellowship (2016-21).
