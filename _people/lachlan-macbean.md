As part of his BSc in Biological Sciences at Bournemouth University, Lachlan conducted research into the genetic factors of type II diabetes, using Drosophila nephrocytes as a model for the human podocyte. In 2018 Lachlan completed an MSc degree in Biotechnology at the University of Essex after researching the relationships between smoking, age-related methylation and blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. In the last year Lachlan has worked at Cambridge Epigenetix as a primary operator of the hydroxymethylcytosine-pulldown pipeline, contributing to the company’s aim of using 5-hydroxymethylcytosine signatures found in cfDNA as a diagnostic tool. Under the supervision of Professor Katie Lunnon, Lachlan is now undergoing a PhD project studying the molecular changes resulting from amyloid-beta immunisation in Alzheimer’s disease through integrated systems-level analyses.
