<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
Alice graduated from the University of Exeter with a BSc Honours degree in Natural Sciences, during which she developed a strong interest in the use of bioinformatics to understand human health and disease. She joined the Complex Disease Epigenetics Group as a graduate research assistant focusing on the DNA methylation changes that occur during human fetal brain development. Alice is now a PhD student funded by the Simons Foundation, focusing on sex differences in DNA methylation across the human life-course. In particular, exploring the epigenetics behind the sex differences observed in neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and schizophrenia.
