Josh completed his BSc Biochemistry (Hons) at the University of Kent in 2016 and following graduation was employed as a Molecular Pathologist at Eli Lilly and Co. in Surrey. His role at Lilly involved histological analysis of pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases. He is particularly interested in neurobiology, genetics and neurodegenerative disease, specifically synucleinopathies. This led Josh to join the Complex Disease Epigenetics Group as a PhD student, with a project investigating epigenetic changes in the brains of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinsons Disease Dementia (PDD) donors. He will be working under the supervision of Professor Katie Lunnon, Dr. Ehsan Pishva and Professor Jonathan Mill and the project is funded by The Charles Wolfson Charitable Trust.
