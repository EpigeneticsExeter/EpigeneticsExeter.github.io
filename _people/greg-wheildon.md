Greg graduated with a BSc in Pharmacology from the University of Bristol and spent time afterwards helping with the management of his family’s business. Greg returned to academia to study for a MSc in Molecular Neuroscience, also at the University of Bristol. It was here that his interest in dementia research grew; his research project investigated the impact of MicroRNAs on neuronal differentiation and the implications this has for dementia. At the University of Exeter Greg is currently doing his PhD investigating epigenetic changes in the HOXA gene cluster in Alzheimer’s Disease
