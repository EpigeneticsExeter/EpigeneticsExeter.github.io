Greg graduated with a BSc in Pharmacology from the University of Bristol and subsequently undertook a MSc in Molecular Neuroscience, also at Bristol. It was here that his interest in neurodegenerative disease grew; his research project investigated the impact of MicroRNAs on neuronal differentiation and the implications this has for dementia. Following this, Greg began his PhD in the Complex Disease Epigenetics group at the University of Exeter. His research focuses on epigenetic mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease, in particular the characterisation of DNA methylation in post-mortem brain tissue of patients who died with these diseases.
