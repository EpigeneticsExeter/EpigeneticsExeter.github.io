Emma is a PhD candidate and bioinformatics graduate research assistant with the Complex Disease Epigenetics Group at the University of Exeter Medical School. She graduated with a BSc in Biological Sciences from the University of Exeter after studying an Access to Higher Education Diploma in Brighton. During her degree she discovered a passion for bioinformatics and statistical modelling, and a fascination for how these can be combined with genomic data to tackle cutting edge questions in science. Her current work focuses on the regulatory genomic signatures of human brain development within the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.
