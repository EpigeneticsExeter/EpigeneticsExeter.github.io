Kamile is a PhD student at the University of Exeter under the supervision of Dr Nicholas Clifton, Professor Jonathan Mill, Dr Eilis Hannon and Dr Jonathan Brown. Prior to this, she obtained a BSc degree in Biomedical Sciences at Brunel University of London, which included a placement year at the National Research Council of Italy, where Kamile analysed the miRNA expression profiles of Fabry disease patients. During her BSc final year, Kamile
took on the role of a research assistant at the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, where she built theoretical and practical knowledge in next generation sequencing
technologies by taking part in the first full-genome sequencing project of SARS-CoV-2 in Lithuania. Recently, she graduated from Imperial College London with an MSc degree in
Genomic Medicine. As part of her MSc degree, Kamile undertook a research project at the UK  Dementia Research Institute  at Imperial, which  focused  on the purification and
characterisation of pA-Tn5 for novel epigenetic/multiomic methods' development for small samples and single cells. During this time, she developed a keen interest in psychiatric
genomics and neuroscience. For her PhD project, she intends to improve and challenge the current literature by modelling the effects of major schizophrenia risk variants in mice and
quantifying their effects on the local synaptic translatome as the brain develops, using ribosome profiling and single cell transcriptomics
