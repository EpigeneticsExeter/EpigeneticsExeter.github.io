<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
My PhD and initial postdoctoral research were focused on the analysis of functional genetic variants in psychiatric disorders; although this approach has been relatively successful it has become apparent that there are other factors at play in complex disorders. During my time as a post-doctoral fellow in Toronto, funded by a University of Toronto International Fellowship, I was involved in a ground-breaking study investigating parent-of-origin DNA methylation in mouse brain which was published in Cell (Xie et al. 2012). On returning to London I was able to continue my research into epigenomics and joined Professors Millâ€™s lab at the Institute of Psychiatry where I spearheaded the first systematic analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation differences in monozygotic twins discordant for psychiatric illnesses. After relocating with Professor Mill to Exeter in 2012 I continued my research into psychiatric epigenetics and was promoted to Lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School in 2015 and then Senior Lecturer in 2021. My current research focus aims to elucidate regulatory genomic variation associated with disease using novel tools such as epigenomic tools based on the CRISPR-cas9 system to understand the role epigenetics play in brain disorders. Another important aspect of my work involves enabling the profiling of the regulatory landscape of discrete cell populations derived from post-mortem brain samples. This project holds significant potential in providing valuable understanding of both neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric disorders.
In summary, my academic journey has revolved around investigating functional genetic variants in psychiatric disorders, which led me to delve into the realm of epigenomics. I have made significant contributions, including pioneering analyses of DNA methylation differences in monozygotic twins and exploring cutting-edge techniques such as the CRISPR-Cas9 system. My dedication to unraveling the regulatory genomic variation associated with disease and gaining insights into neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric disorders drives my ongoing research endeavors.
