Michael is a PhD student at the University of Exeter under the supervision of Professor Katie Lunnon and Dr Emma Dempster. He recently graduated from Imperial College London with a MRes degree in Cancer Biology and previously obtained a BSc (Hons) degree in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Greenwich. Through projects investigating the role of DNA methylation in ovarian cancer progression and the impact of alternative splicing on miRNA regulation, Michael developed a keen interest in epigenetics and gene editing tools. For his PhD, which is entitled “Functional characterisation of epigenetic loci implicated in dementia”, he intends to examine the consequences of loci methylation/de-methylation on cell function by using CRISPR epigenetic editing, as well as epigenomic and transcriptomic methods.
