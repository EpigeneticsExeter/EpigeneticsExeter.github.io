Luke graduated from the University of Exeter in 2015 with a degree in Biological Sciences. Wanting to stay involved in research Luke worked for over four years for the University of Exeter as a technician in the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility (CRF) based in the RILD building. This role involved providing technical support to various research studies, helping to maintain the large Exeter 10,000 biological sample library and helping to manage two sample preparation laboratories. Luke joined the Epigenetics team as a Graduate Research Assistant in January 2020 and primarily works on a project that profiles DNA modifications and gene expression to identify novel pathways involved in the development of psychosis in patients with Alzheimerâ€™s. He also helps to manage the sample archive.
