<!-- DESCRIPTION - PLEASE EDIT THE BELOW -->
Lachlan Ford MacBean is a PhD student in the Complex Disease Epigenomics Group at the University of Exeter. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from Bournemouth University and a Master's degree in Biotechnology from the University of Essex. With a keen interest in Alzheimer's disease research, Lachlan focuses on investigating the relationship between the ageing brain and systemic infections using DNA methylation as a marker for disease progression. Lachlan is also interested in the therapeutic potential of Amyloid-beta immunisation, using a multiomics approach to understand the molecular consequences in patients who participated in the AN1792 clinical trial.
His work aims to unravel the complex epigenetic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Lachlan is committed to making impactful contributions to the field of epigenomics and advancing our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders.
