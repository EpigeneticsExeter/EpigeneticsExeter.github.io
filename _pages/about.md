Sequencing the genome was only the first step in our quest to understand how genes are expressed and functionally regulated. Increased understanding about the functional complexity of the genome has led to growing recognition about the role of epigenetic variation in the etiology of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Epigenetic processes act to dynamically control gene expression independently of DNA sequence variation and are known to regulate key neurobiological and cognitive processes in the brain. Our group takes an integrated genomics approach to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in brain health and disease across the life-course.
