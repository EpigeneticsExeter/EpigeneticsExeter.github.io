Leveraging the power of long-read RNA sequencing, a [new paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34788620/) from our group published in Cell Reports has identified thousands of novel transcripts in the human and mouse cortex. These novel transcripts, not present in existing genome annotations, were characterised with novel splicing events and splice junctions. We further observed differential transcript usage between human fetal and adult cortex, confirming the importance of alternative splicing as an important transcriptional mechanism underpinning gene regulation in the brain. Our transcript-level tracks can be explorer as [UCSC genome browser tracks](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hubUrl=http://genome.exeter.ac.uk/hub/hub.txt) and the raw sequencing data for [human](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA664117/) and [mouse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA663877/) is available to download from SRA.
