Title = {Uncertainty quantification of reference-based cellular deconvolution
   algorithms},
Journal = {EPIGENETICS},
Abstract = {The majority of epigenetic epidemiology studies to date have generated
   genome-wide profiles from bulk tissues (e.g., whole blood) however these
   are vulnerable to confounding from variation in cellular composition.
   Proxies for cellular composition can be mathematically derived from the
   bulk tissue profiles using a deconvolution algorithm; however, there is
   no method to assess the validity of these estimates for a dataset where
   the true cellular proportions are unknown. In this study, we describe,
   validate and characterize a sample level accuracy metric for derived
   cellular heterogeneity variables. The CETYGO score captures the
   deviation between a sample's DNA methylation profile and its expected
   profile given the estimated cellular proportions and cell type reference
   profiles. We demonstrate that the CETYGO score consistently
   distinguishes inaccurate and incomplete deconvolutions when applied to
   reconstructed whole blood profiles. By applying our novel metric to >
   6,300 empirical whole blood profiles, we find that estimating accurate
   cellular composition is influenced by both technical and biological
   variation. In particular, we show that when using a common reference
   panel for whole blood, less accurate estimates are generated for
   females, neonates, older individuals and smokers. Our results highlight
   the utility of a metric to assess the accuracy of cellular
   deconvolution, and describe how it can enhance studies of DNA
   methylation that are reliant on statistical proxies for cellular
   heterogeneity. To facilitate incorporating our methodology into existing
   pipelines, we have made it freely available as an R package
   (https://github.com/ds420/CETYGO).},

Title = {Uncovering the genetic architecture of broad antisocial behavior through
   a genome-wide association study meta-analysis},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY},
Abstract = {Despite the substantial heritability of antisocial behavior (ASB),
   specific genetic variants robustly associated with the trait have not
   been identified. The present study by the Broad Antisocial Behavior
   Consortium (BroadABC) meta-analyzed data from 28 discovery samples (N =
   85,359) and five independent replication samples (N = 8058) with
   genotypic data and broad measures of ASB. We identified the first
   significant genetic associations with broad ASB, involving common
   intronic variants in the forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) gene (lead SNP
   rs12536335, p = 6.32 x 10(-10)). Furthermore, we observed intronic
   variation in Foxp2 and one of its targets (Cntnap2) distinguishing a
   mouse model of pathological aggression (BALB/cJ strain) from controls
   (BALB/cByJ strain). Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses in independent
   samples revealed that the genetic risk for ASB was associated with
   several antisocial outcomes across the lifespan, including diagnosis of
   conduct disorder, official criminal convictions, and trajectories of
   antisocial development. We found substantial genetic correlations of ASB
   with mental health (depression r(g) = 0.63, insomnia r(g) = 0.47),
   physical health (overweight r(g) = 0.19, waist-to-hip ratio r(g) =
   0.32), smoking (r(g) = 0.54), cognitive ability (intelligence r(g) =
   -0.40), educational attainment (years of schooling r(g) = -0.46) and
   reproductive traits (age at first birth r(g) = -0.58, father's age at
   death r(g) = -0.54). Our findings provide a starting point toward
   identifying critical biosocial risk mechanisms for the development of
   ASB.},

Title = {Designing genetic studies for people with intellectual disabilities:
   Practical lessons from a pilot study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES},
Abstract = {Genetic variations are overrepresented in people with intellectual
   disability (PwID), particularly those with physical and mental health
   co-morbidities, but remain significantly under-diagnosed. Lack of
   suitable research studies, a natural extension of the complexities posed
   of consenting and recruitment is considered culpable. There is a
   resultant dearth of evidence on establishing bespoke genetic studies for
   adult PwID. This report outlines the challenges faced in the
   implementation and administration of a pilot genetic study for adult
   PwID hoping to better inform future genetic study designs for PwID.
   Adult participants with a diagnosis of ID (ICD10 F70-F73) and epilepsy
   (ICD10 G40) were recruited to The Peninsula study exploring genomic
   stratification in intellectual disability and epilepsy via the ethically
   approved Royal Devon and Exeter Tissue Bank (RDETB) (16/SC/016). Managed
   within the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Exeter Clinical
   Research Framework, the RDETB was set up to proactively collect and
   store `spare' tissue from routine clinical procedures such as
   venepunctures for routine good practice biochemistry monitoring.
   Participants who satisfied the criteria for the need for routine bloods
   to monitor their general health were identified to be invited for
   participation. From October 2017 to March 2020 from a total caseload of
   375 PwID and epilepsy, 291 were screened (77.6\%), 116 (39.9\%)
   identified as potentially eligible and sent study information and
   genetic samples obtained from 30 (8\%). Analysis showed 75\% of PwID had
   some biochemical abnormalities requiring further medical attention. The
   recruitment was influenced by the clinical care set up in implementing
   the sanctioned ethics. However, where bloods were achieved it proved to
   be beneficial in identifying hitherto undiagnosed medical problems.
   While the challenges to gain consent, are considerable, the reasonable
   adjustments needed to facilitate participation and the immediate
   clinical benefits where engagement was successful are significant.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives
   DNA methylation algorithms are increasingly used to estimate biological
   aging; however, how these proposed measures of whole-organism biological
   aging relate to aging in the brain is not known. We used data from the
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Framingham
   Heart Study (FHS) Offspring Cohort to test the association between
   blood-based DNA methylation measures of biological aging and cognitive
   impairment and dementia in older adults.
   Methods
   We tested 3 ``generations{''} of DNA methylation age algorithms (first
   generation: Horvath and Hannum clocks; second generation: PhenoAge and
   GrimAge; and third generation: DunedinPACE, Dunedin Pace of Aging
   Calculated from the Epigenome) against the following measures of
   cognitive impairment in ADNI: clinical diagnosis of dementia and mild
   cognitive impairment, scores on Alzheimer disease (AD) / Alzheimer
   disease and related dementias (ADRD) screening tests (Alzheimer's
   Disease Assessment Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment), and scores on cognitive tests (Rey Auditory
   Verbal Learning Test, Logical Memory test, and Trail Making Test). In an
   independent replication in the FHS Offspring Cohort, we further tested
   the longitudinal association between the DNA methylation algorithms and
   the risk of developing dementia.
   Results
   In ADNI (N = 649 individuals), the first-generation (Horvath and Hannum
   DNA methylation age clocks) and the second-generation (PhenoAge and
   GrimAge) DNA methylation measures of aging were not consistently
   associated with measures of cognitive impairment in older adults. By
   contrast, a third-generation measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE,
   was associated with clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (beta
   {[}95\% CI] = 0.28 {[}0.08-0.47]), poorer scores on Alzheimer
   disease/ADRD screening tests (beta {[}Robust SE] = -0.10 {[}0.04] to
   0.08{[}0.04]), and cognitive tests (beta {[}Robust SE] = -0.12 {[}0.04]
   to 0.10 {[}0.03]). The association between faster pace of aging, as
   measured by DunedinPACE, and risk of developing dementia was confirmed
   in a longitudinal analysis of the FHS Offspring Cohort (N = 2,264
   individuals, hazard ratio {[}95\% CI] = 1.27 {[}1.07-1.49]).
   Discussion
   Third-generation blood-based DNA methylation measures of aging could
   prove valuable for measuring differences between individuals in the rate
   at which they age and in their risk for cognitive decline, and for
   evaluating interventions to slow aging.},

Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease
   characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta and
   neurofibrillary tangles of tau in the neocortex. We profiled DNA
   methylation in two regions of the cortex from 631 donors, performing an
   epigenome-wide association study of multiple measures of AD
   neuropathology. We meta-analyzed our results with those from previous
   studies of DNA methylation in AD cortex (total n = 2013 donors),
   identifying 334 cortical differentially methylated positions (DMPs)
   associated with AD pathology including methylomic variation at loci not
   previously implicated in dementia. We subsequently profiled DNA
   methylation in NeuN+ (neuronal-enriched), SOX10+
   (oligodendrocyte-enriched) and NeuN-/SOX10- (microglia- and
   astrocyte-enriched) nuclei, finding that the majority of DMPs identified
   in `bulk' cortex tissue reflect DNA methylation differences occurring in
   non-neuronal cells. Our study highlights the power of utilizing multiple
   measures of neuropathology to identify epigenetic signatures of AD and
   the importance of characterizing disease-associated variation in
   purified cell-types.
   Here the authors identify differences in cortical DNA methylation
   associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology, and profiling nuclei from
   specific cell-types, find that most of these differences reflect
   variation occurring in non-neuronal cells.},

Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are closely
   related progressive disorders with no available disease-modifying
   therapy, neuropathologically characterized by intraneuronal aggregates
   of misfolded alpha-synuclein. To explore the role of DNA methylation
   changes in PD and DLB pathogenesis, we performed an epigenome-wide

   replicated results in an independent set of 200 donors. We report novel
   differentially methylated replicating loci associated with Braak Lewy
   body stage near TMCC2, SFMBT2, AKAP6 and PHYHIP. Differentially
   methylated probes were independent of known PD genetic risk alleles.
   Meta-analysis provided suggestive evidence for a differentially

   PD-associated 22q11.2 deletion. Our findings elucidate novel disease
   pathways in PD and DLB and generate hypotheses for future molecular

Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genomic
   regions associated with schizophrenia, although many variants reside in
   noncoding regions characterized by high linkage disequilibrium (LD)
   making the elucidation of molecular mechanisms challenging. A genomic
   region on chromosome 10q24 has been consistently associated with
   schizophrenia with risk attributed to the AS3MT gene. Although AS3MT is
   hypothesized to play a role in neuronal development and differentiation,
   work to fully understand the function of this gene has been limited. In
   this study we explored the function of AS3MT using a neuronal cell line
   (SH-SY5Y). We confirm previous findings of isoform specific expression
   of AS3MT during SH-SY5Y differentiation toward neuronal fates. Using
   CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing we generated AS3MT knockout SH-SY5Y cell lines
   and used RNA-seq to identify significant changes in gene expression in
   pathways associated with neuronal development, inflammation,
   extracellular matrix formation, and RNA processing, including
   dysregulation of other genes strongly implicated in schizophrenia. We
   did not observe any morphological changes in cell size and neurite
   length following neuronal differentiation and MAP2 immunocytochemistry.
   These results provide novel insights into the potential role of AS3MT in
   brain development and identify pathways through which genetic variation
   in this region may confer risk for schizophrenia.},

   including Nanopore sequencing, have the potential to revolutionize the
   generation of epigenetic data, not only by providing genuine genome-wide
   coverage but profiling epigenetic modifications direct from native DNA.
   Here we assess the viability of using Nanopore sequencing for
   epidemiology by performing a comparison with DNA methylation quantified
   using the most comprehensive microarray available, the Illumina EPIC
   array. We implemented a CRISPR-Cas9 targeted sequencing approach in
   concert with Nanopore sequencing to profile DNA methylation in three
   genomic regions to attempt to rediscover genomic positions that existing
   technologies have shown are differentially methylated in tobacco
   smokers. Using Nanopore sequencing reads, DNA methylation was quantified
   at 1779 CpGs across three regions, providing a finer resolution of DNA
   methylation patterns compared to the EPIC array. The correlation of
   estimated levels of DNA methylation between platforms was high.
   Furthermore, we identified 12 CpGs where hypomethylation was
   significantly associated with smoking status, including 10 within the
   AHRR gene. In summary, Nanopore sequencing is a valid option for
   identifying genomic loci where large differences in DNAm are associated
   with a phenotype and has the potential to advance our understanding of
   the role differential methylation plays in the etiology of complex
   disease.},

Abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motoneuron disease with a
   monogenic cause in approximately 10\% of cases. However, familial
   clustering of disease without inheritance in a Mendelian manner and the
   broad range of phenotypes suggest the presence of epigenetic mechanisms.
   Hence, we performed an epigenome-wide association study on sporadic,
   symptomatic and presymptomatic familial ALS cases with mutations in
   C9ORF72 and FUS and healthy controls studying DNA methylation in blood
   cells. We found differentially methylated DNA positions (DMPs) and
   regions embedding DMPs associated with either disease status, C9ORF72 or
   FUS mutation status. One DMP reached methylome-wide significance and is
   attributed to a region encoding a long non-coding RNA (LOC389247).
   Furthermore, we could demonstrate co-localization of DMPs with an
   ALS-associated GWAS region near the SCN7A/SCN9A and XIRP2 genes.
   Finally, a classifier model that predicts disease status (ALS, healthy)
   classified all but one presymptomatic mutation carrier as healthy,
   suggesting that the presence of ALS symptoms rather than the presence of
   ALS-associated genetic mutations is associated with blood cell DNA
   methylation. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A comparison of blood and brain-derived ageing and inflammation-related

Abstract = {Inflammation and ageing-related DNA methylation patterns in the blood
   have been linked to a variety of morbidities, including cognitive
   decline and neurodegenerative disease. However, it is unclear how these
   blood-based patterns relate to patterns within the brain and how each
   associates with central cellular profiles. In this study, we profiled
   DNA methylation in both the blood and in five post mortem brain regions
   (BA17, BA20/21, BA24, BA46 and hippocampus) in 14 individuals from the
   Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Microglial burdens were additionally
   quantified in the same brain regions. DNA methylation signatures of five
   epigenetic ageing biomarkers ('epigenetic clocks'), and two inflammatory
   biomarkers (methylation proxies for C-reactive protein and
   interleukin-6) were compared across tissues and regions. Divergent
   associations between the inflammation and ageing signatures in the blood
   and brain were identified, depending on region assessed. Four out of the
   five assessed epigenetic age acceleration measures were found to be
   highest in the hippocampus (beta range = 0.83-1.14, p <= 0.02). The
   inflammation-related DNA methylation signatures showed no clear
   variation across brain regions. Reactive microglial burdens were found
   to be highest in the hippocampus (beta = 1.32, p = 5 x 10(-4)); however,
   the only association identified between the blood- and brain-based
   methylation signatures and microglia was a significant positive
   association with acceleration of one epigenetic clock (termed DNAm
   PhenoAge) averaged over all five brain regions (beta = 0.40, p = 0.002).
   This work highlights a potential vulnerability of the hippocampus to
   epigenetic ageing and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship
   between DNA methylation signatures in the brain and differences in
   microglial burdens.},

Abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease
   with an estimated heritability between 40 and 50\%. DNA methylation
   patterns can serve as proxies of (past) exposures and disease
   progression, as well as providing a potential mechanism that mediates
   genetic or environmental risk. Here, we present a blood-based
   epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis in 9706 samples passing
   stringent quality control (6763 patients, 2943 controls). We identified
   a total of 45 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) annotated to 42
   genes, which are enriched for pathways and traits related to metabolism,
   cholesterol biosynthesis, and immunity. We then tested 39 DNA
   methylation-based proxies of putative ALS risk factors and found that
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, white blood cell
   proportions, and alcohol intake were independently associated with ALS.
   Integration of these results with our latest genome-wide association
   study showed that cholesterol biosynthesis was potentially causally
   related to ALS. Last, DNA methylation at several DMPs and blood cell
   proportion estimates derived from DNA methylation data were associated
   with survival rate in patients, suggesting that they might represent
   indicators of underlying disease processes potentially amenable to
   therapeutic interventions.},

Title = {DunedinPACE, a DNA methylation biomarker of the pace of aging},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {Background: Measures to quantify changes in the pace of biological aging
   in response to intervention are needed to evaluate geroprotective
   interventions for humans. Previously, we showed that quantification of
   the pace of biological aging from a DNA-methylation blood test was
   possible (Belsky et al., 2020). Here, we report a next-generation
   DNA-methylation biomarker of Pace of Aging, DunedinPACE (for Pace of
   Aging Calculated from the Epigenome). Methods: We used data from the
   Dunedin Study 1972-1973 birth cohort tracking within-individual decline
   in 19 indicators of organ-system integrity across four time points
   spanning two decades to model Pace of Aging. We distilled this
   two-decade Pace of Aging into a single-time-point DNA-methylation
   blood-test using elastic-net regression and a DNA-methylation dataset
   restricted to exclude probes with low test-retest reliability. We
   evaluated the resulting measure, named DunedinPACE, in five additional
   datasets. Results: DunedinPACE showed high test-retest reliability, was
   associated with morbidity, disability, and mortality, and indicated
   faster aging in young adults with childhood adversity. DunedinPACE
   effect-sizes were similar to GrimAge Clock effect-sizes. In analysis of
   incident morbidity, disability, and mortality, DunedinPACE and added
   incremental prediction beyond GrimAge. Conclusions: DunedinPACE is a
   novel blood biomarker of the pace of aging for gerontology and
   geroscience. Funding: This research was supported by US-National
   Institute on Aging grants AG032282, AG061378, AG066887, and UK Medical
   Research Council grant MR/P005918/1.},

Abstract = {A cross-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analysis of amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS) including 29,612 patients with ALS and 122,656
   controls identifies 15 risk loci with distinct genetic architectures and
   neuron-specific biology.
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease
   with a lifetime risk of one in 350 people and an unmet need for
   disease-modifying therapies. We conducted a cross-ancestry genome-wide
   association study (GWAS) including 29,612 patients with ALS and 122,656
   controls, which identified 15 risk loci. When combined with 8,953
   individuals with whole-genome sequencing (6,538 patients, 2,415
   controls) and a large cortex-derived expression quantitative trait locus
   (eQTL) dataset (MetaBrain), analyses revealed locus-specific genetic
   architectures in which we prioritized genes either through rare
   variants, short tandem repeats or regulatory effects. ALS-associated
   risk loci were shared with multiple traits within the neurodegenerative
   spectrum but with distinct enrichment patterns across brain regions and
   cell types. Of the environmental and lifestyle risk factors obtained
   from the literature, Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal
   role for high cholesterol levels. The combination of all ALS-associated
   signals reveals a role for perturbations in vesicle-mediated transport
   and autophagy and provides evidence for cell-autonomous disease
   initiation in glutamatergic neurons.},

Abstract = {Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism
   producing distinct mRNA molecules from a single pre-mRNA with a
   prominent role in the development and function of the central nervous
   system. We used long-read isoform sequencing to generate full-length
   transcript sequences in the human and mouse cortex. We identify novel
   transcripts not present in existing genome annotations, including
   transcripts mapping to putative novel (unannotated) genes and fusion
   transcripts incorporating exons from multiple genes. Global patterns of
   transcript diversity are similar between human and mouse cortex,
   although certain genes are characterized by striking differences between
   species. We also identify developmental changes in alternative splicing,
   with differential transcript usage between human fetal and adult cortex.
   Our data confirm the importance of alternative splicing in the cortex,
   dramatically increasing transcriptional diversity and representing an
   important mechanism underpinning gene regulation in the brain. We
   provide transcript-level data for human and mouse cortex as a resource
   to the scientific community.},

Abstract = {Common genetic variation appears to largely influence risk for
   neuropsychiatric disorders through effects on gene regulation. It is
   therefore possible to shed light on the biology of these conditions by
   testing for enrichment of associated genetic variation within regulatory
   genomic regions operating in specific tissues or cell types. Here, we
   have used the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with
   high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-Seq) to map open chromatin (an index of
   active regulatory genomic regions) in bulk tissue, NeuN+ and NeuN-
   nuclei from the prenatal human frontal cortex, and tested enrichment of
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability for five
   neuropsychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder {[}ADHD], bipolar disorder, major depressive
   disorder, and schizophrenia) within these regions. We observed
   significant enrichment of SNP heritability for ADHD, major depressive
   disorder, and schizophrenia within open chromatin regions (OCRs) mapped
   in bulk fetal frontal cortex, and for all five tested neuropsychiatric
   conditions when we restricted these sites to those overlapping histone
   modifications indicative of enhancers (H3K4me1) or promoters (H3K4me3)
   in fetal brain. SNP heritability for neuropsychiatric disorders was
   significantly enriched in OCRs identified in fetal frontal cortex NeuN-
   as well as NeuN+ nuclei overlapping fetal brain H3K4me1 or H3K4me3
   sites. We additionally demonstrate the utility of our mapped OCRs for
   prioritizing potentially functional SNPs at genome-wide significant risk
   loci for neuropsychiatric disorders. Our data provide evidence for an
   early neurodevelopmental component to a range of neuropsychiatric
   conditions and highlight an important role for regulatory genomic
   regions active within both NeuN+ and NeuN- cells of the prenatal brain.},

Abstract = {The mechanisms underlying how monozygotic (or identical) twins arise are
   yet to be determined. Here, the authors investigate this in an
   epigenome-wide association study, showing that monozygotic twinning has
   a characteristic DNA methylation signature in adult somatic tissues.
   Monozygotic (MZ) twins and higher-order multiples arise when a zygote
   splits during pre-implantation stages of development. The mechanisms
   underpinning this event have remained a mystery. Because MZ twinning
   rarely runs in families, the leading hypothesis is that it occurs at
   random. Here, we show that MZ twinning is strongly associated with a
   stable DNA methylation signature in adult somatic tissues. This
   signature spans regions near telomeres and centromeres,
   Polycomb-repressed regions and heterochromatin, genes involved in
   cell-adhesion, WNT signaling, cell fate, and putative human metastable
   epialleles. Our study also demonstrates a never-anticipated corollary:
   because identical twins keep a lifelong molecular signature, we can
   retrospectively diagnose if a person was conceived as monozygotic twin.},

   Characterizing genetic influences on DNA methylation (DNAm) provides an
   opportunity to understand mechanisms underpinning gene regulation and
   disease. In the present study, we describe results of DNAm quantitative
   trait locus (mQTL) analyses on 32,851 participants, identifying genetic
   variants associated with DNAm at 420,509 DNAm sites in blood. We present
   a database of >270,000 independent mQTLs, of which 8.5\% comprise
   long-range (trans) associations. Identified mQTL associations explain
   15-17\% of the additive genetic variance of DNAm. We show that the
   genetic architecture of DNAm levels is highly polygenic. Using shared
   genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks,
   identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic
   annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated
   with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of
   cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to
   trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype-phenotype map
   than previously anticipated.},

Title = {A machine learning case-control classifier for schizophrenia based on
   DNA methylation in blood},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Epigenetic dysregulation is thought to contribute to the etiology of
   schizophrenia (SZ), but the cell type-specificity of DNA methylation
   makes population-based epigenetic studies of SZ challenging. To train an
   SZ case-control classifier based on DNA methylation in blood, therefore,
   we focused on human genomic regions of systemic interindividual
   epigenetic variation (CoRSIVs), a subset of which are represented on the
   Illumina Human Methylation 450K (HM450) array. HM450 DNA methylation
   data on whole blood of 414 SZ cases and 433 non-psychiatric controls
   were used as training data for a classification algorithm with built-in
   feature selection, sparse partial least squares discriminate analysis
   (SPLS-DA); application of SPLS-DA to HM450 data has not been previously
   reported. Using the first two SPLS-DA dimensions we calculated a ``risk
   distance{''} to identify individuals with the highest probability of SZ.
   The model was then evaluated on an independent HM450 data set on 353 SZ
   cases and 322 non-psychiatric controls. Our CoRSIV-based model
   classified 303 individuals as cases with a positive predictive value
   (PPV) of 80\%, far surpassing the performance of a model based on
   polygenic risk score (PRS). Importantly, risk distance (based on CoRSIV
   methylation) was not associated with medication use, arguing against
   reverse causality. Risk distance and PRS were positively correlated
   (Pearson r = 0.28, P = 1.28 x 10(-12)), and mediational analysis
   suggested that genetic effects on SZ are partially mediated by altered
   methylation at CoRSIVs. Our results indicate two innate dimensions of SZ
   risk: one based on genetic, and the other on systemic epigenetic
   variants.},

Title = {DNA methylation-based sex classifier to predict sex and identify sex
   chromosome aneuploidy},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {Background: Sex is an important covariate of epigenome-wide association
   studies due to its strong influence on DNA methylation patterns across
   numerous genomic positions. Nevertheless, many samples on the Gene
   Expression Omnibus (GEO) frequently lack a sex annotation or are
   incorrectly labelled. Considering the influence that sex imposes on DNA
   methylation patterns, it is necessary to ensure that methods for
   filtering poor samples and checking of sex assignment are accurate and
   widely applicable.
   Results: Here we presented a novel method to predict sex using only DNA
   methylation beta values, which can be readily applied to almost all DNA
   methylation datasets of different formats (raw IDATs or text files with
   only signal intensities) uploaded to GEO. We identified 4345
   significantly (p<0.01) sex-associated CpG sites present on both 450K and
   EPIC arrays, and constructed a sex classifier based on the two first
   principal components of the DNA methylation data of sex-associated
   probes mapped on sex chromosomes. The proposed method is constructed
   using whole blood samples and exhibits good performance across a wide
   range of tissues. We further demonstrated that our method can be used to
   identify samples with sex chromosome aneuploidy, this function is
   validated by five Turner syndrome cases and one Klinefelter syndrome
   case.
   Conclusions: This proposed sex classifier not only can be used for sex
   predictions but also applied to identify samples with sex chromosome
   aneuploidy, and it is freely and easily accessible by calling the
   `estimateSex' function from the newest wateRmelon Bioconductor package
   (https://github.com/schalkwyk/wateRmelon).},

Title = {Novel epigenetic clock for fetal brain development predicts prenatal age

Abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated neurons
   (iPSC-neurons) are a widely used cellular model in the research of the
   central nervous system. However, it is unknown how well they capture
   age-associated processes, particularly given that pluripotent cells are
   only present during the earliest stages of mammalian development.
   Epigenetic clocks utilize coordinated age-associated changes in DNA
   methylation to make predictions that correlate strongly with
   chronological age. It has been shown that the induction of pluripotency
   rejuvenates predicted epigenetic age. As existing clocks are not
   optimized for the study of brain development, we developed the fetal
   brain clock (FBC), a bespoke epigenetic clock trained in human prenatal
   brain samples in order to investigate more precisely the epigenetic age
   of iPSCs and iPSC-neurons. The FBC was tested in two independent
   validation cohorts across a total of 194 samples, confirming that the
   FBC outperforms other established epigenetic clocks in fetal brain
   cohorts. We applied the FBC to DNA methylation data from iPSCs and
   embryonic stem cells and their derived neuronal precursor cells and
   neurons, finding that these cell types are epigenetically characterized
   as having an early fetal age. Furthermore, while differentiation from
   iPSCs to neurons significantly increases epigenetic age, iPSC-neurons
   are still predicted as being fetal. Together our findings reiterate the
   need to better understand the limitations of existing epigenetic clocks
   for answering biological research questions and highlight a limitation
   of iPSC-neurons as a cellular model of age-related diseases.},

Title = {The association of epigenetic clocks in brain tissue with brain
   pathologies and common aging phenotypes},
Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {157},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Epigenetic clocks are calculated by combining DNA methylation states
   across select CpG sites to estimate biologic age, and have been noted as
   the most successful markers of biologic aging to date. Yet, limited
   research has considered epigenetic clocks calculated in brain tissue. We
   used DNA methylation states in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specimens
   from 721 older participants of the Religious Orders Study and Rush
   Memory and Aging Project, to calculate DNA methylation age using four
   established epigenetic clocks: Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and a
   new Cortical clock. The four established clocks were trained in blood
   samples (Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge) or using 51 human tissue and cell
   types (Horvath); the recent Cortical clock is the first trained in
   postmortem cortical tissue. Participants were recruited beginning in
   1994 (Religious Orders Study) and 1997 (Memory and Aging Project), and
   followed annually with questionnaires and clinical evaluations; brain
   specimens were obtained for 80-90\% of participants. Mean age at death
   was 88.0 (SD 6.7) years. We used linear regression, logistic regression,
   and linear mixed models, to examine relations of epigenetic clock ages
   to neuropathologic and clinical aging phenotypes, controlling for
   chronologic age, sex, education, and depressive symptomatology. Hannum,
   Horvath, PhenoAge and Cortical clock ages were related to pathologic
   diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to A beta load (a
   hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease). However, associations were
   substantially stronger for the Cortical than other clocks; for example,
   each standard deviation (SD) increase in Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge
   clock age was related to approximately 30\% greater likelihood of
   pathologic AD (all p < 0.05), while each SD increase in Cortical age was
   related to 90\% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (odds ratio = 1.91,
   95\% confidence interval 1.38, 2.62). Moreover, Cortical age was
   significantly related to other AD pathology (eg, mean tau tangle
   density, p = 0.003), and to odds of neocortical Lewy body pathology (for
   each SD increase in Cortical age, odds ratio = 2.00, 95\% confidence
   1.27, 3.17), although no clocks were related to cerebrovascular
   neuropathology. Cortical age was the only epigenetic clock significantly
   associated with the clinical phenotypes examined, from dementia to
   cognitive decline (5 specific cognitive systems, and a global cognitive
   measure averaging 17 tasks) to Parkinsonian signs. Overall, our findings

Title = {Characterizing the properties of bisulfite sequencing data: maximizing
   power and sensitivity to identify between-group differences in DNA
   methylation},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Background The combination of sodium bisulfite treatment with
   highly-parallel sequencing is a common method for quantifying DNA
   methylation across the genome. The power to detect between-group
   differences in DNA methylation using bisulfite-sequencing approaches is
   influenced by both experimental (e.g. read depth, missing data and
   sample size) and biological (e.g. mean level of DNA methylation and
   difference between groups) parameters. There is, however, no consensus
   about the optimal thresholds for filtering bisulfite sequencing data
   with implications for the reproducibility of findings in epigenetic
   epidemiology. Results We used a large reduced representation bisulfite
   sequencing (RRBS) dataset to assess the distribution of read depth
   across DNA methylation sites and the extent of missing data. To
   investigate how various study variables influence power to identify DNA
   methylation differences between groups, we developed a framework for
   simulating bisulfite sequencing data. As expected, sequencing read
   depth, group size, and the magnitude of DNA methylation difference
   between groups all impacted upon statistical power. The influence on
   power was not dependent on one specific parameter, but reflected the
   combination of study-specific variables. As a resource to the community,
   we have developed a tool, POWEREDBiSeq, which utilizes our simulation
   framework to predict study-specific power for the identification of DNAm
   differences between groups, taking into account user-defined read depth
   filtering parameters and the minimum sample size per group. Conclusions
   Our data-driven approach highlights the importance of filtering
   bisulfite-sequencing data by minimum read depth and illustrates how the
   choice of threshold is influenced by the specific study design and the
   expected differences between groups being compared. The POWEREDBiSeq
   tool, which can be applied to different types of bisulfite sequencing
   data (e.g. RRBS, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), targeted
   bisulfite sequencing and amplicon-based bisulfite sequencing), can help
   users identify the level of data filtering needed to optimize power and
   aims to improve the reproducibility of bisulfite sequencing studies.},

Abstract = {Epigenome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease have

   different brain regions. Here, we combine data from six DNA methylomic
   studies of Alzheimer's disease (N=1453 unique individuals) to identify
   differential methylation associated with Braak stage in different brain
   regions and across cortex. We identify 236 CpGs in the prefrontal
   cortex, 95 CpGs in the temporal gyrus and ten CpGs in the entorhinal
   cortex at Bonferroni significance, with none in the cerebellum. Our
   cross-cortex meta-analysis (N=1408 donors) identifies 220 CpGs
   associated with neuropathology, annotated to 121 genes, of which 84
   genes have not been previously reported at this significance threshold.
   We have replicated our findings using two further DNA methylomic
   datasets consisting of a further >600 unique donors. The meta-analysis

Abstract = {Controlling aggression is a crucial skill in social species like rodents
   and humans and has been associated with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
   Here, we directly link the failed regulation of aggression in BALB/cJ
   mice to ACC hypofunction. We first show that ACC in BALB/cJ mice is
   structurally degraded: neuron density is decreased, with pervasive
   neuron death and reactive astroglia. Gene-set enrichment analysis
   suggested that this process is driven by neuronal degeneration, which
   then triggers toxic astrogliosis. cFos expression across ACC indicated
   functional consequences: during aggressive encounters, ACC was engaged
   in control mice, but not BALB/cJ mice. Chemogenetically activating ACC
   during aggressive encounters drastically suppressed pathological
   aggression but left species-typical aggression intact. The network
   effects of our chemogenetic perturbation suggest that this behavioral
   rescue is mediated by suppression of amygdala and hypothalamus and
   activation of mediodorsal thalamus. Together, these findings highlight
   the central role of ACC in curbing pathological aggression.},

Title = {Meta-analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation identifies shared

Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Background People with neurodegenerative disorders show diverse clinical
   syndromes, genetic heterogeneity, and distinct brain pathological
   changes, but studies report overlap between these features. DNA
   methylation (DNAm) provides a way to explore this overlap and
   heterogeneity as it is determined by the combined effects of genetic
   variation and the environment. In this study, we aim to identify shared
   blood DNAm differences between controls and people with Alzheimer's
   disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Results
   We use a mixed-linear model method (MOMENT) that accounts for the effect
   of (un)known confounders, to test for the association of each DNAm site
   with each disorder. While only three probes are found to be genome-wide
   significant in each MOMENT association analysis of amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (and none with Alzheimer's disease), a
   fixed-effects meta-analysis of the three disorders results in 12
   genome-wide significant differentially methylated positions. Predicted
   immune cell-type proportions are disrupted across all neurodegenerative
   disorders. Protein inflammatory markers are correlated with profile
   sum-scores derived from disease-associated immune cell-type proportions
   in a healthy aging cohort. In contrast, they are not correlated with
   MOMENT DNAm-derived profile sum-scores, calculated using effect sizes of
   the 12 differentially methylated positions as weights. Conclusions We
   identify shared differentially methylated positions in whole blood
   between neurodegenerative disorders that point to shared pathogenic
   mechanisms. These shared differentially methylated positions may reflect
   causes or consequences of disease, but they are unlikely to reflect
   cell-type proportion differences.},

Abstract = {Most epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) quantify DNA methylation
   (DNAm) in peripheral tissues such as whole blood to identify positions
   in the genome where variation is statistically associated with a trait

   buccal epithelial and nasal epithelial cells) from thirty individuals.
   Whole blood samples were subsequently processed using
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify five constituent
   cell-types (monocytes, granulocytes, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and
   B cells). DNAm was profiled in all eight sample-types from each
   individual using the Illumina EPIC array. We identified significant
   differences in both the level and variability of DNAm between different
   sample types, and DNAm data-derived estimates of age and smoking were
   found to differ dramatically across sample types from the same
   individual. We found that for the majority of loci variation in DNAm in
   individual blood cell types was only weakly predictive of variance in
   DNAm measured in whole blood, although the proportion of variance
   explained was greater than that explained by either buccal or nasal
   epithelial samples. Covariation across sample types was much higher for
   DNAm sites influenced by genetic factors. Overall, we observe that DNAm
   variation in whole blood is additively influenced by a combination of
   the major blood cell types. For a subset of sites, however, variable
   DNAm detected in whole blood can be attributed to variation in a single
   blood cell type providing potential mechanistic insight about EWAS
   findings. Our results suggest that associations between whole blood DNAm
   and traits or exposures reflect differences in multiple cell types and
   our data will facilitate the interpretation of findings in epigenetic
   epidemiology.
   Author summary
   As epigenetic variation is cell-type specific, an ongoing challenge in
   epigenetic epidemiology is how to interpret studies performed using bulk
   tissue (for example, whole blood) which comprises a mix of different
   cell types. In this study, we identified major differences in DNA
   methylation (DNAm) across multiple peripheral tissues and different
   blood cell types, with each sample type being characterized by a unique
   signature across multiple genomic loci. We demonstrate how these
   differences influence commonly used prediction scores derived from DNAm
   data for age and tobacco smoking, with estimates for the same individual
   being highly variable across tissues and cell types. Our results enabled
   us to assess the extent to which variable DNAm in each individual blood
   cell type relates to variation measured in whole blood. We found that
   although individual blood cell types predict more of the variation in
   DNAm in whole blood compared to buccal and nasal epithelial cells, the
   actual proportion of variance explained is relatively small, except for
   at sites where DNAm is under genetic control. Our data indicate that for
   most sites variation in multiple blood cell types additively combines to
   drive variation in DNAm measured in whole blood. Of note, for a subset
   of sites, variation in DNAm detected in whole blood can be attributed to
   a specific blood cell type, potentially facilitating the interpretation
   of EWAS findings.},

Journal = {ELIFE},

Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {We performed a systematic analysis of blood DNA methylation profiles
   from 4483 participants from seven independent cohorts identifying
   differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with psychosis,
   schizophrenia, and treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Psychosis cases
   were characterized by significant differences in measures of blood cell
   proportions and elevated smoking exposure derived from the DNA
   methylation data, with the largest differences seen in
   treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients. We implemented a stringent
   pipeline to meta-analyze epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results
   across datasets, identifying 95 DMPs associated with psychosis and 1048
   DMPs associated with schizophrenia, with evidence of colocalization to
   regions nominated by genetic association studies of disease. Many
   schizophrenia-associated DNA methylation differences were only present
   in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, potentially
   reflecting exposure to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Our results
   highlight how DNA methylation data can be leveraged to identify
   physiological (e.g., differential cell counts) and environmental (e.g.,
   smoking) factors associated with psychosis and molecular biomarkers of
   treatment-resistant schizophrenia.},

Abstract = {Lay abstract
   Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people worldwide and numerous
   genetic association studies have been undertaken in the disease in
   recent years. The expression of genes can be altered by epigenetic
   processes, which include modifications to the DNA or histone proteins.
   Several studies have now reported increased DNA methylation in the ANK1
   gene in Alzheimer's disease brain samples. However, to date no studies
   have explored histone modifications in this gene in the disease. Here,
   we show decreased levels of the H3K4me3 modification in regions of the
   ANK1 gene in the entorhinal cortex of Alzheimer's disease brain samples,
   which is a marker of active gene expression. This study further supports
   a role for epigenetic modifications in the ANK1 gene in Alzheimer's
   disease pathology.
   Several epigenome-wide association studies of DNA methylation have
   highlighted altered DNA methylation in the ANK1 gene in Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) brain samples. However, no study has specifically examined
   ANK1 histone modifications in the disease. We use chromatin
   immunoprecipitation-qPCR to quantify tri-methylation at histone 3 lysine
   4 (H3K4me3) and 27 (H3K27me3) in the ANK1 gene in entorhinal cortex from
   donors with high (n = 59) or low (n = 29) Alzheimer's disease pathology.
   We demonstrate decreased levels of H3K4me3, a marker of active gene
   transcription, with no change in H3K27me3, a marker of inactive genes.
   H3K4me3 is negatively correlated with DNA methylation in specific
   regions of the ANK1 gene. Our study suggests that the ANK1 gene shows
   altered epigenetic marks indicative of reduced gene activation in
   Alzheimer's disease.},

Abstract = {DNA methylation profiles of aggressive behavior may capture lifetime
   cumulative effects of genetic, stochastic, and environmental influences
   associated with aggression. Here, we report the first large
   meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of aggressive
   behavior (N = 15,324 participants). In peripheral blood samples of
   14,434 participants from 18 cohorts with mean ages ranging from 7 to 68
   years, 13 methylation sites were significantly associated with
   aggression (alpha = 1.2 x 10(-7); Bonferroni correction). In cord blood
   samples of 2425 children from five cohorts with aggression assessed at
   mean ages ranging from 4 to 7 years, 83\% of these sites showed the same
   direction of association with childhood aggression (r = 0.74, p = 0.006)
   but no epigenome-wide significant sites were found. Top-sites (48 at a
   false discovery rate of 5\% in the peripheral blood meta-analysis or in
   a combined meta-analysis of peripheral blood and cord blood) have been
   associated with chemical exposures, smoking, cognition, metabolic
   traits, and genetic variation (mQTLs). Three genes whose expression
   levels were associated with top-sites were previously linked to
   schizophrenia and general risk tolerance. At six CpGs, DNA methylation
   variation in blood mirrors variation in the brain. On average 44\%
   (range = 3-82\%) of the aggression-methylation association was explained
   by current and former smoking and BMI. These findings point at loci that
   are sensitive to chemical exposures with potential implications for
   neuronal functions. We hope these results to be a starting point for
   studies leading to applications as peripheral biomarkers and to reveal
   causal relationships with aggression and related traits.},

Abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that individuals exposed to victimization
   at key developmental stages may have different epigenetic fingerprints
   compared to those exposed to no/minimal stressful events, however
   results are inconclusive. This study aimed to strengthen causal
   inference regarding the impact of adolescent victimization on the
   epigenome by controlling for genetic variation, age, gender, and shared
   environmental exposures. We conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide
   association analyses (EWAS) on DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of 118
   monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs from the Environmental Risk study with and
   without severe adolescent victimization generated using buccal DNA
   collected at ages 5, 10 and 18, and the Illumina EPIC array.
   Additionally, we performed cross-sectional EWAS on age-18 blood and
   buccal DNA from the same individuals to elucidate tissue-specific
   signatures of severe adolescent victimization. Our analyses identified
   20 suggestive differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (P < 5e-05),
   with altered DNAm trajectories between ages 10-18 associated with severe
   adolescent victimization ( increment Beta range = -5.5\%-5.3\%). Age-18
   cross-sectional analyses revealed 72 blood ( increment Beta range =
   -2.2\%-3.4\%) and 42 buccal ( increment Beta range = -3.6\%-4.6\%)
   suggestive severe adolescent victimization-associated DMPs, with some
   evidence of convergent signals between these two tissue types.
   Downstream regional analysis identified significant differentially
   methylated regions (DMRs) in LGR6 and ANK3 (Sidak P = 5e-09 and
   4.07e-06), and one upstream of CCL27 (Sidak P = 2.80e-06) in age-18
   blood and buccal EWAS, respectively. Our study represents the first
   longitudinal MZ twin analysis of DNAm and severe adolescent
   victimization, providing initial evidence for altered DNA methylomic
   signatures in individuals exposed to adolescent victimization.},

Abstract = {Illumina DNA methylation arrays are a widely used tool for performing
   genome-wide DNA methylation analyses. However, measurements obtained
   from these arrays may be affected by technical artefacts that result in
   spurious associations if left unchecked. Cross-reactivity represents one
   of the major challenges, meaning that probes may map to multiple regions
   in the genome. Although several studies have reported on this issue, few
   studies have empirically examined the impact of cross-reactivity in an
   epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). In this paper, we report on
   cross-reactivity issues that we discovered in a large EWAS on the
   presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion in ALS patients. Specifically,
   we found that that the majority of the significant probes inadvertently
   cross-hybridized to the C9orf72 locus. Importantly, these probes were
   not flagged as cross-reactive in previous studies, leading to novel
   insights into the extent to which cross-reactivity can impact EWAS. Our
   findings are particularly relevant for epigenetic studies into diseases
   associated with repeat expansions and other types of structural
   variation. More generally however, considering that most spurious
   associations were not excluded based on pre-defined sets of
   cross-reactive probes, we believe that the presented data-driven flag
   and consider approach is relevant for any type of EWAS.},

Abstract = {Human DNA methylation data have been used to develop biomarkers of
   ageing, referred to as `epigenetic clocks', which have been widely used
   to identify differences between chronological age and biological age in
   health and disease including neurodegeneration, dementia and other brain
   phenotypes. Existing DNA methylation clocks have been shown to be highly
   accurate in blood but are less precise when used in older samples or in
   tissue types not included in training the model, including brain. We
   aimed to develop a novel epigenetic clock that performs optimally in
   human cortex tissue and has the potential to identify phenotypes
   associated with biological ageing in the brain. We generated an
   extensive dataset of human cortex DNA methylation data spanning the life
   course (n=1397, ages = 1 to 108 years). This dataset was split into
   `training' and `testing' samples (training: n=1047; testing: n=350). DNA
   methylation age estimators were derived using a transformed version of
   chronological age on DNA methylation at specific sites using elastic net
   regression, a supervised machine learning method. The cortical clock was
   subsequently validated in a novel independent human cortex dataset
   (n=1221, ages = 41 to 104 years) and tested for specificity in a large
   whole blood dataset (n=1175, ages = 28 to 98 years). We identified a set
   of 347 DNA methylation sites that, in combination, optimally predict age
   in the human cortex. The sum of DNA methylation levels at these sites
   weighted by their regression coefficients provide the cortical DNA
   methylation clock age estimate. The novel clock dramatically
   outperformed previously reported clocks in additional cortical datasets.
   Our findings suggest that previous associations between predicted DNA
   methylation age and neurodegenerative phenotypes might represent false
   positives resulting from clocks not robustly calibrated to the tissue
   being tested and for phenotypes that become manifest in older ages. The
   age distribution and tissue type of samples included in training
   datasets need to be considered when building and applying epigenetic
   clock algorithms to human epidemiological or disease cohorts.},

Title = {An epigenome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease blood

Abstract = {A growing number of epigenome-wide association studies have demonstrated
   a role for DNA methylation in the brain in Alzheimer's disease. With the
   aim of exploring peripheral biomarker potential, we have examined DNA
   methylation patterns in whole blood collected from 284 individuals in
   the Add-NeuroMed study, which included 89 nondemented controls, 86
   patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 109 individuals with mild
   cognitive impairment, including 38 individuals who progressed to
   Alzheimer's disease within 1 year. We identified significant
   differentially methylated regions, including 12 adjacent hypermethylated
   probes in the HOXB6 gene in Alzheimer's disease, which we validated
   using pyrosequencing. Using weighted gene correlation network analysis,
   we identified comethylated modules of genes that were associated with
   key variables such as APOE genotype and diagnosis. In summary, this
   study represents the first large-scale epigenome-wide association study
   of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using blood. We
   highlight the differences in various loci and pathways in early disease,
   suggesting that these patterns relate to cognitive decline at an early
   stage. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a phenotypically and genetically
   heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Despite this heterogeneity,
   previous studies have shown patterns of molecular convergence in
   post-mortem brain tissue from autistic subjects. Here, we integrate
   genome-wide measures of mRNA expression, miRNA expression, DNA
   methylation, and histone acetylation from ASD and control brains to
   identify a convergent molecular subtype of ASD with shared dysregulation
   across both the epigenome and transcriptome. Focusing on this convergent
   subtype, we substantially expand the repertoire of differentially
   expressed genes in ASD and identify a component of upregulated immune
   processes that are associated with hypomethylation. We utilize eQTL and
   chromosome conformation datasets to link differentially acetylated
   regions with their cognate genes and identify an enrichment of ASD
   genetic risk variants in hyperacetylated noncoding regulatory regions
   linked to neuronal genes. These findings help elucidate how diverse
   genetic risk factors converge onto specific molecular processes in ASD.
   Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
   characterized by impaired social interactions with repetitive and
   restrictive behaviours. Here the authors integrate mRNA expression,
   miRNA expression, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation datasets from
   a collection of post mortem brain tissues and identify a convergent

Abstract = {DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is the most commonly mutated gene in
   clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Somatic DNMT3A mutations arise in
   hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) many years before malignancies develop,
   but difficulties in comparing their impact before malignancy with
   wild-type cells have limited the understanding of their contributions to
   transformation. To circumvent this limitation, we derived normal and
   DNMT3A mutant lymphoblastoid cell lines from a germline mosaic
   individual in whom these cells co-existed for nearly 6 decades. Mutant
   cells dominated the blood system, but not other tissues. Deep sequencing
   revealed similar mutational burdens and signatures in normal and mutant
   clones, while epigenetic profiling uncovered the focal erosion of DNA
   methylation at oncogenic regulatory regions in mutant clones. These
   regions overlapped with those sensitive to DNMT3A loss after DNMT3A
   ablation in HSCs and in leukemia samples. These results suggest that
   DNMT3A maintains a conserved DNA methylation pattern, the erosion of
   which provides a distinct competitive advantage to hematopoietic cells.},

Abstract = {Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19 (coronavirus
   disease 2019), but its etiology is unknown. A key question is whether
   SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; CoV-2)-the
   causal agent in COVID-19-affects olfaction directly, by infecting
   olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or
   indirectly, by perturbing support cells. Bulk and single-cell RNA
   sequencing revealed that support and stem cells in the human and mouse
   olfactory epithelium and vascular pericytes in the mouse olfactory bulb
   express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is essential for
   CoV-2 cell entry. In contrast, ACE2 was not detected in either olfactory
   sensory neurons or olfactory bulb neurons. Immunostaining confirmed
   these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in
   dorsally located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and mouse
   olfactory bulb pericytes. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of
   non-neuronal cell types leads to olfactory dysfunction in patients with

Abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable
   neurodevelopmental disorder that often persists into adulthood. There is
   growing evidence that epigenetic dysregulation participates in ADHD.
   Given that only a limited number of epigenome-wide association studies
   (EWASs) of ADHD have been conducted so far and they have mainly focused
   on pediatric and population-based samples, we performed an EWAS in a
   clinical sample of adults with ADHD. We report one CpG site and four
   regions differentially methylated between patients and controls, which
   are located in or near genes previously involved in autoimmune diseases,
   cancer or neuroticism. Our sensitivity analyses indicate that smoking
   status is not responsible for these results and that polygenic risk
   burden for ADHD does not greatly impact the signatures identified.
   Additionally, we show an overlap of our EWAS findings with genetic
   signatures previously described for ADHD and with epigenetic signatures
   for smoking behavior and maternal smoking. These findings support a role
   of DNA methylation in ADHD and emphasize the need for additional efforts
   in larger samples to clarify the role of epigenetic mechanisms on ADHD
   across the lifespan.},

Title = {Association of Neighborhood Disadvantage in Childhood With DNA
   Methylation in Young Adulthood},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Importance DNA methylation has been proposed as an epigenetic mechanism
   by which the childhood neighborhood environment may have implications
   for the genome that compromise adult health. Objective To ascertain
   whether childhood neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated
   with differences in DNA methylation by age 18 years. Design, Setting,
   and Participants This longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from the
   Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally
   representative birth cohort of children born between 1994 and 1995 in
   England and Wales and followed up from age 5 to 18 years. Data analysis
   was performed from March 15, 2019, to June 30, 2019. Exposures
   High-resolution neighborhood data (indexing deprivation, dilapidation,
   disconnection, and dangerousness) collected across childhood. Main
   Outcomes and Measures DNA methylation in whole blood was drawn at age 18
   years. Associations between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and
   methylation were tested using 3 prespecified approaches: (1) testing
   probes annotated to candidate genes involved in biological responses to
   growing up in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods and
   investigated in previous epigenetic research (stress reactivity-related
   and inflammation-related genes), (2) polyepigenetic scores indexing
   differential methylation in phenotypes associated with growing up in
   disadvantaged neighborhoods (obesity, inflammation, and smoking), and
   (3) a theory-free epigenome-wide association study. Results A total of
   1619 participants (806 female individuals {[}50\%]) had complete
   neighborhood and DNA methylation data. Children raised in
   socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods exhibited differential DNA
   methylation in genes involved in inflammation (beta = 0.12; 95\% CI,
   0.06-0.19; P < .001) and smoking (beta = 0.18; 95\% CI, 0.11-0.25; P <
   .001) but not obesity (beta = 0.05; 95\% CI, -0.01 to 0.11; P = .12). An
   epigenome-wide association study identified multiple CpG sites at an
   arraywide significance level of P < 1.16 x 10(-7) in genes involved in
   the metabolism of hydrocarbons. Associations between neighborhood
   disadvantage and methylation were small but robust to family-level
   socioeconomic factors and to individual-level tobacco smoking.
   Conclusions and Relevance Children raised in more socioeconomically
   disadvantaged neighborhoods appeared to enter young adulthood
   epigenetically distinct from their less disadvantaged peers. This
   finding suggests that epigenetic regulation may be a mechanism by which
   the childhood neighborhood environment alters adult health.
   Question Is childhood neighborhood disadvantage associated with
   differential DNA methylation? Findings In this cohort study of 1619
   children in Great Britain, exposure to neighborhood socioeconomic
   disadvantage during childhood was associated with differential DNA
   methylation at age 18 years in genes involved in inflammation, exposure
   to tobacco smoke, and metabolism of toxic air pollutants. Meaning The
   study found that children who were raised in socioeconomically
   disadvantaged neighborhoods appeared to enter young adulthood
   epigenetically distinct from their more advantaged peers.
   This cohort study traces the biological responses and associated
   phenotypes of an upbringing in a socially and economically disadvantaged
   environment.},

   DNA Methylation Measurement},
Journal = {PATTERNS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {DNA methylation plays an important role in both normal human development
   and risk of disease. The most utilized method of assessing DNA
   methylation uses BeadChips, generating an epigenome-wide ``snapshot'' of
   >450,000 observations (probe measurements) per assay. However, the
   reliability of each of these measurements is not equal, and little
   consideration is paid to consequences for research. We correlated repeat
   measurements of the same DNA samples using the Illumina
   HumanMethylation450K and the Infinium Methylation-EPIC BeadChips in 350
   blood DNA samples. Probes that were reliably measured were more
   heritable and showed consistent associations with environmental
   exposures, gene expression, and greater cross-tissue concordance.
   Unreliable probes were less replicable and generated an unknown volume
   of false negatives. This serves as a lesson for working with DNA
   methylation data, but the lessons are equally applicable to working with
   other data: as we advance toward generating increasingly greater volumes
   of data, failure to document reliability risks harming reproducibility.},

Title = {Quantification of the pace of biological aging in humans through a blood
   test, the DunedinPoAm DNA methylation algorithm},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {Biological aging is the gradual, progressive decline in system integrity
   that occurs with advancing chronological age, causing morbidity and
   disability. Measurements of the pace of aging are needed as surrogate
   endpoints in trials of therapies designed to prevent disease by slowing
   biological aging. We report a blood-DNA-methylation measure that is
   sensitive to variation in pace of biological aging among individuals
   born the same year. We first modeled change-over-time in 18 biomarkers
   tracking organ-system integrity across 12 years of follow-up in n = 954
   members of the Dunedin Study born in 1972-1973. Rates of change in each
   biomarker over ages 26-38 years were composited to form a measure of
   aging-related decline, termed Pace-of-Aging. Elastic-net regression was
   used to develop a DNA-methylation predictor of Pace-of-Aging, called
   DunedinPoAm for Dunedin(P)ace(o)f(A)ging(m)ethylation. Validation
   analysis in cohort studies and the CALERIE trial provide
   proof-of-principle for DunedinPoAm as a single-time-point measure of a
   person's pace of biological aging.},

Title = {Psychosis-associated DNA methylomic variation in Alzheimer's disease
   cortex},
Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {83-88},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Psychotic symptoms are a common and debilitating feature of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and are associated with a more rapid course of decline.
   Current evidence from postmortem and neuroimaging studies implicates
   frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, with reported disruptions in
   monoaminergic pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying
   this remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated methylomic
   variation associated with AD psychosis in 3 key brain regions implicated
   in the etiology of psychosis (prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and
   superior temporal gyrus) in postmortem brain samples from 29 AD donors
   with psychosis and 18 matched AD donors without psychosis. We identified
   psychosis-associated methylomic changes in a number of loci, with these
   genes being enriched in known schizophrenia-associated genetic and
   epigenetic variants. One of these known loci resided in the AS3MT
   gene-previously implicated in schizophrenia in a large GWAS
   meta-analysis. We used bisulfite-pyrosequencing to confirm
   hypomethylation across 4 neighboring CpG sites in the ASM3T gene.
   Finally, our regional analysis nominated multiple CpG sites in TBX15 and
   WT1, which are genes that have been previously implicated in AD. Thus
   one potential implication from our study is whether psychosis-associated
   variation drives reported associations in AD case-control studies. (C)

Title = {Major surgery induces acute changes in measured DNA methylation
   associated with immune response pathways},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Surgery is an invasive procedure evoking acute inflammatory and immune
   responses that can influence risk for postoperative complications
   including cognitive dysfunction and delirium. Although the specific
   mechanisms driving these responses have not been well-characterized,
   they are hypothesized to involve the epigenetic regulation of gene
   expression. We quantified genome-wide levels of DNA methylation in
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) longitudinally collected from
   a cohort of elderly patients undergoing major surgery, comparing samples
   collected at baseline to those collected immediately post-operatively
   and at discharge from hospital. We identified acute changes in measured
   DNA methylation at sites annotated to immune system genes, paralleling
   changes in serum-levels of markers including C-reactive protein (CRP)
   and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) measured in the same individuals. Many of the
   observed changes in measured DNA methylation were consistent across
   different types of major surgery, although there was notable
   heterogeneity between surgery types at certain loci. The acute changes
   in measured DNA methylation induced by surgery are relatively stable in
   the postoperative period, generally persisting until discharge from
   hospital. Our results highlight the dramatic alterations in gene
   regulation induced by invasive surgery, primarily reflecting
   upregulation of the immune system in response to trauma, wound healing
   and anaesthesia.},

Journal = {SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {319-327},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Methylome-wide association studies (MWASs) are promising complements to
   sequence variation studies. We used existing sequencing-based
   methylation data, which assayed the majority of all 28 million CpGs in
   the human genome, to perform an MWAS for schizophrenia in blood, while
   controlling for cell-type heterogeneity with a recently generated
   platform-specific reference panel. Next, we compared the MWAS results
   with findings from 3 existing large-scale array-based schizophrenia
   methylation studies in blood that assayed up to similar to 450 000 CpGs.
   Our MWAS identified 22 highly significant loci ( P < 5 x 10(-8)) and 852
   suggestively significant loci (P < 1 x 10(-5)). The top finding (P =
   5.62 x 10(-11), q = 0.001) was located in MFN2, which encodes
   mitofusin-2 that regulates Ca2+ transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum
   to mitochondria in cooperation with DISC1. The second-most significant
   site (P = 1.38 x 10(-9), q = 0.013) was located in ALDH1A2, which
   encodes an enzyme for astrocyte-derived retinoic acid-a key neuronal
   morphogen with relevance for schizophrenia. Although the most
   significant MWAS findings were not assayed on the arrays, we observed
   significant enrichment of overlapping findings with 2 of the 3 array
   datasets (P = 0.0315, 0.0045, 0.1946). Overrepresentation analysis of
   Gene Ontology terms for the genes in the significant overlaps suggested
   high similarity in the biological functions detected by the different
   datasets. Top terms were related to immune and/or stress responses, cell
   adhesion and motility, and a broad range of processes essential for
   neurodevelopment.},

Title = {Genome-wide DNA methylation meta-analysis in the brains of suicide
   completers},

Abstract = {Suicide is the second leading cause of death globally among young people
   representing a significant global health burden. Although the molecular
   correlates of suicide remains poorly understood, it has been
   hypothesised that epigenomic processes may play a role. The objective of
   this study was to identify suicide-associated DNA methylation changes in
   the human brain by utilising previously published and unpublished
   methylomic datasets. We analysed prefrontal cortex (PFC, n = 211) and
   cerebellum (CER, n = 114) DNA methylation profiles from suicide
   completers and non-psychiatric, sudden-death controls, meta-analysing
   data from independent cohorts for each brain region separately. We
   report evidence for altered DNA methylation at several genetic loci in
   suicide cases compared to controls in both brain regions with
   suicide-associated differentially methylated positions enriched among
   functional pathways relevant to psychiatric phenotypes and suicidality,
   including nervous system development (PFC) and regulation of long-term
   synaptic depression (CER). In addition, we examined the functional
   consequences of variable DNA methylation within a PFC suicide-associated
   differentially methylated region (PSORS1C3 DMR) using a dual luciferase
   assay and examined expression of nearby genes. DNA methylation within
   this region was associated with decreased expression of firefly
   luciferase but was not associated with expression of nearby genes,
   PSORS1C3 and POU5F1. Our data suggest that suicide is associated with
   DNA methylation, offering novel insights into the molecular pathology
   associated with suicidality.},

Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the intracellular
   aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau and the accumulation of b-amyloid
   in the neocortex. We use transgenic mice harboring human tau (rTg4510)
   and amyloid precursor protein (J20) mutations to investigate
   transcriptional changes associated with the progression of tau and
   amyloid pathology. rTg4510 mice are characterized by widespread
   transcriptional differences in the entorhinal cortex with changes
   paralleling neuropathological burden across multiple brain regions.
   Differentially expressed transcripts overlap with genes identified in
   genetic studies of familial and sporadic AD. Systems-level analyses
   identify discrete co-expression networks associated with the progressive
   accumulation of tau that are enriched for genes and pathways previously
   implicated in AD pathology and overlap with co-expression networks
   identified in human AD cortex. Our data provide further evidence for an
   immune-response component in the accumulation of tau and reveal
   molecular pathways associated with the progression of AD neuropathology.},

Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that is used to treat
   schizophrenia patients who are resistant to other antipsychotic drugs.
   The molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of clozapine are not well
   understood and its use is often associated with severe side-effects. In
   this study, we exposed groups of wild-type zebrafish to two doses of
   clozapine ('low' (20 mu g/L) and `high' (70 mu g/L)) over a 72-h period,
   observing dose-dependent effects on behaviour. Using RNA sequencing
   (RNA-seq) we identified multiple genes differentially expressed in the
   zebrafish brain following exposure to clozapine. Network analysis
   identified co-expression modules characterised by striking changes in
   module connectivity in response to clozapine, and these were enriched
   for regulatory pathways relevant to the etiology of schizophrenia. Our
   study highlights the utility of zebrafish as a model for assessing the
   molecular consequences of antipsychotic medications and identifies
   genomic networks potentially involved in schizophrenia.},

Title = {Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Patterns in Persistent
   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and in Association With
   Impulsive and Callous Traits},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental
   disorder that often persists into adulthood. ADHD and related
   personality traits, such as impulsivity and callousness, are caused by
   genetic and environmental factors and their interplay. Epigenetic
   modifications of DNA, including methylation, are thought to mediate
   between such factors and behavior and may behave as biomarkers for
   disorders. Here, we set out to study DNA methylation in persistent ADHD
   and related traits. We performed epigenome-wide association studies
   (EWASs) on peripheral whole blood from participants in the NeuroIMAGE
   study (age range 12-23 years). We compared participants with persistent
   ADHD (n = 35) with healthy controls (n = 19) and with participants with
   remittent ADHD (n = 19). Additionally, we performed EWASs of impulsive
   and callous traits derived from the Conners Parent Rating Scale and the
   Callous-Unemotional Inventory, respectively, across all participants.
   For every EWAS, the linear regression model analyzed included covariates
   for age, sex, smoking scores, and surrogate variables reflecting blood
   cell type composition and genetic background. We observed no
   epigenome-wide significant differences in single CpG site methylation
   between participants with persistent ADHD and healthy controls or
   participants with remittent ADHD. However, epigenome-wide analysis of
   differentially methylated regions provided significant findings showing
   that hypermethylated regions in the APOB and LPAR5 genes were associated
   with ADHD persistence compared to ADHD remittance (p = 1.68 {*} 10(-24)
   and p = 9.06 {*} 10(-7), respectively); both genes are involved in
   cholesterol signaling. Both findings appeared to be linked to genetic
   variation in cis. We found neither significant epigenome-wide single CpG
   sites nor regions associated with impulsive and callous traits; the
   top-hits from these analyses were annotated to genes involved in
   neurotransmitter release and the regulation of the biological clock. No
   link to genetic variation was observed for these findings, which thus
   might reflect environmental influences. In conclusion, in this pilot
   study with a small sample size, we observed several
   DNA-methylation-disorder/trait associations of potential significance
   for ADHD and the related behavioral traits. Although we do not wish to
   draw conclusions before replication in larger, independent samples,
   cholesterol signaling and metabolism may be of relevance for the onset
   and/or persistence of ADHD.},

Title = {Large epigenome-wide association study of childhood ADHD identifies

   burden},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Epigenetic variation in peripheral tissues is being widely studied as a
   molecular biomarker of complex disease and disease-related exposures. To
   date, few studies have examined differences in DNA methylation
   associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this
   study, we profiled genetic and methylomic variation across the genome in
   saliva samples from children (age 7-12 years) with clinically
   established ADHD (N=391) and nonpsychiatric controls (N=213). We tested
   for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with both ADHD
   diagnosis and ADHD polygenic risk score, by using linear regression
   models including smoking, medication effects, and other potential
   confounders in our statistical models. Our results support previously
   reported associations between ADHD and DNA methylation levels at sites
   annotated to VIPR2, and identify several novel disease-associated DMPs
   (p<1e-5), although none of them were genome-wide significant. The two
   top-ranked, ADHD-associated DMPs (cg17478313 annotated to SLC7A8 and
   cg21609804 annotated to MARK2) are also significantly associated with
   nearby SNPs (p=1.2e-46 and p=2.07e-59), providing evidence that
   disease-associated DMPs are under genetic control. We also report a
   genome-wide significant association between ADHD polygenic risk and
   variable DNA methylation at a site annotated to the promoter of GART and
   SON (p=6.71E-8). Finally, we show that ADHD-associated SNPs colocalize
   with SNPs associated with methylation levels in saliva. This is the
   first large-scale study of DNA methylation in children with ADHD. Our
   results represent novel epigenetic biomarkers for ADHD that may be
   useful for patient stratification, reinforce the importance of genetic
   effects on DNA methylation, and provide plausible molecular mechanisms
   for ADHD risk variants.},

Title = {Genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease influences neuropathology via
   multiple biological pathways},
Journal = {BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a highly heritable, common neurodegenerative
   disease characterized neuropathologically by the accumulation of
   beta-amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. In
   addition to the well-established risk associated with the APOE locus,
   there has been considerable success in identifying additional genetic
   variants associated with Alzheimer's disease. Major challenges in
   understanding how genetic risk influences the development of Alzheimer's
   disease are clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity, and the high
   level of accompanying comorbidities. We report a multimodal analysis
   integrating longitudinal clinical and cognitive assessment with
   neuropathological data collected as part of the Brains for Dementia
   Research study to understand how genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's
   disease influence the development of neuropathology and clinical
   performance. Six hundred and ninety-three donors in the Brains for
   Dementia Research cohort with genetic data, semi-quantitative
   neuropathology measurements, cognitive assessments and established
   diagnostic criteria were included in this study. We tested the
   association of APOE genotype and Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk
   score-a quantitative measure of genetic burden-with survival, four
   common neuropathological features in Alzheimer's disease brains
   (neurofibrillary tangles, beta-amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies and
   transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 proteinopathy), clinical
   status (clinical dementia rating) and cognitive performance (Mini-Mental
   State Exam, Montreal Cognitive Assessment). The APOE epsilon 4 allele
   was significantly associated with younger age of death in the Brains for
   Dementia Research cohort. Our analyses of neuropathology highlighted two
   independent pathways from APOE epsilon 4, one where beta-amyloid
   accumulation co-occurs with the development of tauopathy, and a second
   characterized by direct effects on tauopathy independent of
   beta-amyloidosis. Although we also detected association between APOE
   epsilon 4 and dementia status and cognitive performance, these were all
   mediated by tauopathy, highlighting that they are a consequence of the
   neuropathological changes. Analyses of polygenic risk score identified
   associations with tauopathy and beta-amyloidosis, which appeared to have
   both shared and unique contributions, suggesting that different genetic
   variants associated with Alzheimer's disease affect different features
   of neuropathology to different degrees. Taken together, our results
   provide insight into how genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease influences
   both the clinical and pathological features of dementia, increasing our
   understanding about the interplay between APOE genotype and other
   genetic risk factors.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke/thromboembolic events, infections, and death are all
   significantly increased by antipsychotics in dementia but little is
   known about why they can be harmful. Using a novel application of a drug
   repurposing paradigm, we aimed to identify potential mechanisms
   underlying adverse events.
   Methods: Whole transcriptome signatures were generated for SH-SY5Y cells
   treated with amisulpride, risperidone, and volinanserin using RNA
   sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis was performed that scored the
   association between antipsychotic signatures and expression data from
   415,252 samples in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
   Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) repository.
   Results: Atherosclerosis, venous thromboembolism, and influenza NCBI
   GEO-derived samples scored positively against antipsychotic signatures.
   Pathways enriched in antipsychotic signatures were linked to the
   cardiovascular and immune systems (eg, brain derived neurotrophic factor
   {[}BDNF], platelet derived growth factor receptor {[}PDGFR]-beta, tumor
   necrosis factor {[}TNF], transforming growth factor {[}TGF]-beta,
   selenoamino acid metabolism, and influenza infection).
   Conclusions: These findings for the first time mechanistically link
   antipsychotics to specific cardiovascular and infectious diseases which
   are known side effects of their use in dementia, providing new
   information to explain related adverse events.},

Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Background: The Horvath epigenetic clock is widely used. It predicts age
   quite well from 353 CpG sites in the DNA methylation profile in unknown
   samples and has been used to calculate ``age acceleration{''} in various
   tissues and environments.
   Results: The model systematically underestimates age in tissues from
   older people. This is seen in all examined tissues but most strongly in
   the cerebellum and is consistently observed in multiple datasets. Age
   acceleration is thus age-dependent, and this can lead to spurious
   associations. The current literature includes examples of association
   tests with age acceleration calculated in a wide variety of ways.
   Conclusions: The concept of an epigenetic clock is compelling, but
   caution should be taken in interpreting associations with age
   acceleration. Association tests of age acceleration should include age
   as a covariate.},

Abstract = {Background Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex
   multifactorial affliction, the pathogenesis of which is thought to
   involve gene-environment interactions that might be captured in the
   epigenome. The present study investigated epigenome-wide patterns of DNA
   methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) and hydroxymethylation
   (5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5hmC), as well as the abundance of unmodified
   cytosine (UC), in relation to AD. Results We identified epigenetic
   differences in AD patients (n = 45) as compared to age-matched controls
   (n = 35) in the middle temporal gyrus, pertaining to genomic regions
   close to or overlapping with genes such as OXT (- 3.76\% 5mC, p(Sidak) =
   1.07E-06), CHRNB1 (+ 1.46\% 5hmC, p(Sidak) = 4.01E-04), RHBDF2 (- 3.45\%
   UC, p(Sidak) = 4.85E-06), and C3 (- 1.20\% UC, p(Sidak) = 1.57E-03). In
   parallel, in an independent cohort, we compared the blood methylome of
   converters to AD dementia (n = 54) and non-converters (n = 42), at a
   preclinical stage. DNA methylation in the same region of the OXT
   promoter as found in the brain was found to be associated with
   subsequent conversion to AD dementia in the blood of elderly,
   non-demented individuals (+ 3.43\% 5mC, p(Sidak) = 7.14E-04).
   Conclusions The implication of genome-wide significant differential
   methylation of OXT, encoding oxytocin, in two independent cohorts
   indicates it is a promising target for future studies on early
   biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies in AD.},

Title = {RNA sequencing of identical twins discordant for autism reveals
   blood-based signatures implicating immune and transcriptional
   dysregulation},
Journal = {MOLECULAR AUTISM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {BackgroundA gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of how genetic
   and environmental risk factors converge at the molecular level to result
   in the emergence of autism symptoms. We compared blood-based gene
   expression signatures in identical twins concordant and discordant for
   autism spectrum condition (ASC) to differentiate genetic and
   environmentally driven transcription differences, and establish
   convergent evidence for biological mechanisms involved in
   ASC.MethodsGenome-wide gene expression data were generated using RNA-seq
   on whole blood samples taken from 16 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins and
   seven twin pair members (39 individuals in total), who had been assessed
   for ASC and autism traits at age 12. Differential expression (DE)
   analyses were performed between (a) affected and unaffected subjects
   (N=36) and (b) within discordant ASC MZ twin pairs (total N=11) to
   identify environmental-driven DE. Gene set enrichment and pathway
   testing was performed on DE gene lists. Finally, an integrative analysis
   using DNA methylation data aimed to identify genes with consistent
   evidence for altered regulation in cis.ResultsIn the discordant twin
   analysis, three genes showed evidence for DE at FDR<10\%: IGHG4, EVI2A
   and SNORD15B. In the case-control analysis, four DE genes were
   identified at FDR<10\% including IGHG4, PRR13P5, DEPDC1B, and ZNF501. We
   find enrichment for DE of genes curated in the SFARI human gene
   database. Pathways showing evidence of enrichment included those related
   to immune cell signalling and immune response, transcriptional control
   and cell cycle/proliferation. Integrative methylomic and transcriptomic
   analysis identified a number of genes showing suggestive evidence for
   cis dysregulation.LimitationsIdentical twins stably discordant for ASC
   are rare, and as such the sample size was limited and constrained to the
   use of peripheral blood tissue for transcriptomic and methylomic
   profiling. Given these primary limitations, we focused on
   transcript-level analysis.ConclusionsUsing a cohort of ASC discordant
   and concordant MZ twins, we add to the growing body of
   transcriptomic-based evidence for an immune-based component in the
   molecular aetiology of ASC. Whilst the sample size was limited, the
   study demonstrates the utility of the discordant MZ twin design combined
   with multi-omics integration for maximising the potential to identify
   disease-associated molecular signals.},

Title = {Epigenome-wide Association Study of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported associations between
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and DNA methylation in
   children. We report the first epigenome-wide association study
   meta-analysis of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
   symptoms, based on peripheral blood DNA methylation (Infinium
   HunnanMethylation450K array) in three population-based adult cohorts.
   METHODS: An epigenome-wide association study was performed in the
   Netherlands Twin Register (N = 2258, mean age 37 years), Dunedin
   Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (N = 800, age 38 years),
   and Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study (N = 1631, age 18 years),
   and results were combined through meta-analysis (total sample size N =
   4689). Region-based analyses accounting for the correlation between
   nearby methylation sites were also performed.
   RESULTS: One epigenome-wide significant differentially methylated
   position was detected in the Dunedin study, but meta-analysis did not
   detect differentially methylated positions that were robustly associated
   across cohorts. In region-based analyses, six significant differentially
   methylation regions (DMRs) were identified in the Netherlands Twin
   Register, 19 in the Dunedin study, and none in the Environmental Risk
   Longitudinal Twin Study. Of these DMRs, 92\% were associated with
   methylation quantitative trait loci, and 68\% showed moderate to large
   blood-brain correlations for DNA methylation levels. DMRs included six
   nonoverlapping DMRs (three in the Netherlands Twin Register, three in
   the Dunedin study) in the major histocompatibility complex, which were
   associated with expression of genes in the major histocompatibility
   complex, including C4A and C4B, previously implicated in schizophrenia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point at new candidate loci involved in immune
   and neuronal functions that await further replication. Our work also
   illustrates the need for further research to examine to what extent
   epigenetic associations with psychiatric traits depend on
   characteristics such as age, comorbidities, exposures, and genetic
   background.},

Abstract = {Germline mutations in fundamental epigenetic regulatory molecules
   including DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) are commonly associated
   with growth disorders, whereas somatic mutations are often associated
   with malignancy. We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in
   DNMT3A c.2312G > A; p.(Arg771Gln) carriers in a large Amish sibship with
   Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome (TBRS), their mosaic father, and 15 TBRS
   patients with distinct pathogenic de novo DNMT3A variants. This defined
   widespread DNA hypomethylation at specific genomic sites enriched at
   locations annotated as genes involved in morphogenesis, development,
   differentiation, and malignancy predisposition pathways. TBRS patients
   also displayed highly accelerated DNA methylation aging. These findings
   were most marked in a carrier of the AML-associated driver mutation
   p.Arg882Cys. Our studies additionally defined phenotype-related
   accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging in two histone
   methyltransferase disorders: NSD1 Sotos syndrome overgrowth disorder and
   KMT2D Kabuki syndrome growth impairment. Together, our findings provide
   fundamental new insights into aberrant epigenetic mechanisms, the role
   of epigenetic machinery maintenance, and determinants of biological

Title = {Methylation age acceleration does not predict mortality in schizophrenia},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Schizophrenia (SCZ) is associated with high mortality. DNA methylation
   levels vary over the life course, and pre-selected combinations of
   methylation array probes can be used to estimate ``methylation age{''}
   (mAge). mAge correlates highly with chronological age but when it
   differs, termed mAge acceleration, it has been previously associated
   with all-cause mortality. We tested the association between mAge
   acceleration and mortality in SCZ and controls. We selected 190 SCZ
   cases and 190 controls from the Sweden Schizophrenia Study. Cases were
   identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register with >= 5
   specialist treatment contacts and >= 5 antipsychotic prescriptions.
   Controls had no psychotic disorder or antipsychotics. Subjects were
   selected if they had died or survived during follow-up (2:1
   oversampling). Extracted DNA was assayed on the Illumina MethylationEPIC
   array. mAge was regressed on age at sampling to obtain mAge
   acceleration. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, the association
   between mAge acceleration and mortality was tested. After quality
   control, the following were available: n = 126 SCZ died, 63 SCZ alive,
   127 controls died, 62 controls alive. In the primary analyses, we did
   not find a significant association between mAge acceleration and SCZ
   mortality (adjusted p > 0.005). Sensitivity analyses excluding SCZ cases
   with pre-existing cancer demonstrated a significant association between
   the Hannum mAge acceleration and mortality (hazard ratio = 1.13, 95\%
   confidence interval = 1.04-1.22, p = 0.005). Per our pre-specified
   criteria, we did not confirm our primary hypothesis that mAge
   acceleration would predict subsequent mortality in people with SCZ, but
   we cannot rule out smaller effects or effects in patient subsets.},

Abstract = {Young people's life chances can be predicted by characteristics of their
   neighbourhood'. Children growing up in disadvantaged neighbourhoods
   exhibit worse physical and mental health and suffer poorer educational
   and economic outcomes than children growing up in advantaged
   neighbourhoods. Increasing recognition that aspects of social
   inequalities tend, in fact, to be geographical inequalities 2-5 is
   stimulating research and focusing policy interest on the role of place
   in shaping health, behaviour and social outcomes. Where neighbourhood
   effects are causal, neighbourhood-level interventions can be effective.
   Where neighbourhood effects reflect selection of families with different
   characteristics into different neighbourhoods, interventions should
   instead target families or individuals directly. To test how selection
   may affect different neighbourhood-linked problems, we linked
   neighbourhood data with genetic, health and social outcome data for
   >7,000 European-descent UK and US young people in the E-Risk and Add
   Health studies. We tested selection/concentration of genetic risks for
   obesity, schizophrenia, teen pregnancy and poor educational outcomes in
   high-risk neighbourhoods, including genetic analysis of neighbourhood
   mobility. Findings argue against genetic selection/concentration as an
   explanation for neighbourhood gradients in obesity and mental health

Title = {Guidance for DNA methylation studies: statistical insights from the
   Illumina EPIC array},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {BackgroundThere has been a steady increase in the number of studies
   aiming to identify DNA methylation differences associated with complex
   phenotypes. Many of the challenges of epigenetic epidemiology regarding
   study design and interpretation have been discussed in detail, however
   there are analytical concerns that are outstanding and require further
   exploration. In this study we seek to address three analytical issues.
   First, we quantify the multiple testing burden and propose a standard
   statistical significance threshold for identifying DNA methylation sites
   that are associated with an outcome. Second, we establish whether linear
   regression, the chosen statistical tool for the majority of studies, is
   appropriate and whether it is biased by the underlying distribution of
   DNA methylation data. Finally, we assess the sample size required for
   adequately powered DNA methylation association studies.ResultsWe
   quantified DNA methylation in the Understanding Society cohort (n=1175),
   a large population based study, using the Illumina EPIC array to assess
   the statistical properties of DNA methylation association analyses. By
   simulating null DNA methylation studies, we generated the distribution
   of p-values expected by chance and calculated the 5\% family-wise error
   for EPIC array studies to be 9x10(-8). Next, we tested whether the
   assumptions of linear regression are violated by DNA methylation data
   and found that the majority of sites do not satisfy the assumption of
   normal residuals. Nevertheless, we found no evidence that this bias
   influences analyses by increasing the likelihood of affected sites to be
   false positives. Finally, we performed power calculations for EPIC based
   DNA methylation studies, demonstrating that existing studies with data
   on similar to 1000 samples are adequately powered to detect small
   differences at the majority of sites.ConclusionWe propose that a
   significance threshold of P<9x10(-8) adequately controls the false
   positive rate for EPIC array DNA methylation studies. Moreover, our
   results indicate that linear regression is a valid statistical
   methodology for DNA methylation studies, despite the fact that the data
   do not always satisfy the assumptions of this test. These findings have
   implications for epidemiological-based studies of DNA methylation and
   provide a framework for the interpretation of findings from current and
   future studies.},

Abstract = {There is great interest in the role epigenetic variation induced by
   non-genetic exposures may play in the context of health and disease. In
   particular, DNA methylation has previously been shown to be highly
   dynamic during the earliest stages of development and is influenced by
   in utero exposures such as maternal smoking and medication. In this
   study we sought to identify the specific DNA methylation differences in
   blood associated with prenatal and birth factors, including birth
   weight, gestational age and maternal smoking. We quantified neonatal
   methylomic variation in 1263 infants using DNA isolated from a unique
   collection of archived blood spots taken shortly after birth (mean =
   6.08 days; s.d. = 3.24 days). An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS)
   of gestational age and birth weight identified 4299 and 18
   differentially methylated positions (DMPs) respectively, at an
   experiment-wide significance threshold of p < 1 x 10(-7). Our EWAS of
   maternal smoking during pregnancy identified 110 DMPs in neonatal blood,
   replicating previously reported genomic loci, including AHRR. Finally,
   we tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation mediates the relationship
   between maternal smoking and lower birth weight, finding evidence that
   methylomic variation at three DMPs may link exposure to outcome. These
   findings complement an expanding literature on the epigenomic
   consequences of prenatal exposures and obstetric factors,},

Title = {Parallel profiling of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation highlights
   neuropathology-associated epigenetic variation in Alzheimer's disease},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIGENETICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative
   disorder that is hypothesized to involve epigenetic dysfunction.
   Previous studies of DNA modifications in Alzheimer's disease have been
   unable to distinguish between DNA methylation and DNA
   hydroxymethylation. DNA hydroxymethylation has been shown to be enriched
   in the human brain, although its role in Alzheimer's disease has not yet
   been fully explored. Here, we utilize oxidative bisulfite conversion, in
   conjunction with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K
   microarray, to identify neuropathology-associated differential DNA
   methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation in the entorhinal cortex.
   Results: We identified one experiment-wide significant differentially
   methylated position residing in the WNT5B gene. Next, we investigated
   pathology-associated regions consisting of multiple adjacent loci. We
   identified one significant differentially hydroxymethylated region
   consisting of four probes spanning 104 bases in the FBXL16 gene. We also
   identified two significant differentially methylated regions: one
   consisting of two probes in a 93 base-pair region in the ANK1 gene and
   the other consisting of six probes in a 99-base pair region in the
   ARID5B gene. We also highlighted three regions that show alterations in
   unmodified cytosine: two probes in a 39-base pair region of ALLC, two
   probes in a 69-base pair region in JAG2, and the same six probes in
   ARID5B that were differentially methylated. Finally, we replicated
   significant ANK1 disease-associated hypermethylation and
   hypohydroxymethylation patterns across eight CpG sites in an extended
   118-base pair region in an independent cohort using oxidative-bisulfite
   pyrosequencing.
   Conclusions: Our study represents the first epigenome-wide association
   study of both DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in Alzheimer's
   disease entorhinal cortex. We demonstrate that previous estimates of DNA
   hypermethylation in ANK1 in Alzheimer's disease were underestimates as
   it is confounded by hypohydroxymethylation.},

Abstract = {Motivation The datasets generated by DNA methylation analyses are
   getting bigger. With the release of the HumanMethylationEPIC micro-array
   and datasets containing thousands of samples, analyses of these large
   datasets using R are becoming impractical due to large memory
   requirements. As a result there is an increasing need for
   computationally efficient methodologies to perform meaningful analysis
   on high dimensional data.
   Results Here we introduce the bigmelon R package, which provides a
   memory efficient workflow that enables users to perform the complex,
   large scale analyses required in epigenome wide association studies
   (EWAS) without the need for large RAM. Building on top of the CoreArray
   Genomic Data Structure file format and libraries packaged in the gdsfmt
   package, we provide a practical workflow that facilitates the
   reading-in, preprocessing, quality control and statistical analysis of
   DNA methylation data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the bigmelon
   package using a large dataset consisting of 1193 human blood samples
   from the Understanding Society: UK Household Longitudinal Study, assayed
   on the EPIC micro-array platform.
   Availability and implementation The bigmelon package is available on
   Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/bigmelon/). The
   Understanding Society dataset is available at

Title = {Establishing a generalized polyepigenetic biomarker for tobacco smoking},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Large-scale epigenome-wide association meta-analyses have identified
   multiple `signatures'' of smoking. Drawing on these findings, we
   describe the construction of a polyepigenetic DNA methylation score that
   indexes smoking behavior and that can be utilized for multiple purposes
   in population health research. To validate the score, we use data from
   two birth cohort studies: The Dunedin Longitudinal Study, followed to
   age-38 years, and the Environmental Risk Study, followed to age-18
   years. Longitudinal data show that changes in DNA methylation accumulate
   with increased exposure to tobacco smoking and attenuate with quitting.
   Data from twins discordant for smoking behavior show that smoking
   influences DNA methylation independently of genetic and environmental
   risk factors. Physiological data show that changes in DNA methylation
   track smoking-related changes in lung function and gum health over time.
   Moreover, DNA methylation changes predict corresponding changes in gene
   expression in pathways related to inflammation, immune response, and
   cellular trafficking. Finally, we present prospective data about the
   link between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and epigenetic
   modifications; these findings document the importance of controlling for
   smoking-related DNA methylation changes when studying biological
   embedding of stress in life-course research. We introduce the
   polyepigenetic DNA methylation score as a tool both for discovery and
   theory-guided research in epigenetic epidemiology.},

Title = {Longitudinal investigation of DNA methylation changes preceding
   adolescent psychotic experiences},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Childhood psychotic experiences (PEs), such as seeing or hearing things
   that others do not, or extreme paranoia, are relatively common with
   around 1 in 20 children reporting them at age 12. Childhood PEs are
   often distressing and can be predictive of schizophrenia, other
   psychiatric disorders, and suicide attempts in adulthood, particularly
   if they persist during adolescence. Previous research has demonstrated
   that methylomic signatures in blood could be potential biomarkers of
   psychotic phenomena. This study explores the association between DNA
   methylation (DNAm) and the emergence, persistence, and remission of PEs
   in childhood and adolescence. DNAm profiles were obtained from the
   ALSPAC cohort at birth, age 7, and age 15/17 (n = 901). PEs were
   assessed through interviews with participants at ages 12 and 18. We
   identified PE-associated probes (p < 5x10-5) and regions (corrected p <
   0.05) at ages 12 and 18. Several of the differentially methylated probes
   were also associated with the continuity of PEs across adolescence. One
   probe (cg16459265), detected consistently at multiple timepoints in the
   study sample, was replicated in an independent sample of twins (n =
   1658). Six regions, including those spanning the HLA-DBP2 and GDF7
   genes, were consistently differentially methylated at ages 7 and 15-17.
   Findings from this large, population-based study suggest that DNAm at
   multiple stages of development may be associated with PEs in late
   childhood and adolescence, though further replication is required.
   Research uncovering biomarkers associated with pre-clinical PEs is
   important as it has the potential to facilitate early identification of
   individuals at increased risk who could benefit from preventive
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Schizophrenia is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by
   episodes of psychosis and altered cognitive functioning. Epigenetic
   processes, which developmentally regulate gene expression via
   modifications to DNA, histone proteins, and chromatin, have been widely
   heralded as the `missing piece' of the etiological puzzle for many
   neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including
   schizophrenia. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge
   of epigenetic mechanisms in schizophrenia, highlighting how future work
   integrating these data with recent genetic findings will facilitate our
   understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology.},

Title = {A cross-brain regions study of ANK1 DNA methylation in different
   neurodegenerative diseases},
Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {70-76},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent epigenome-wide association studies in Alzheimer's disease have
   highlighted consistent robust neuropathology-associated DNA
   hypermethylation of the ankyrin 1 (ANK1) gene in the cortex. The extent
   to which altered ANK1 DNA methylation is also associated with other
   neurodegenerative diseases is not currently known. In the present study,
   we used bisulfite pyrosequencing to quantify DNA methylation across 8
   CpG sites within a 118 bp region of the ANK1 gene across multiple brain
   regions in Alzheimer's disease, Vascular dementia, Dementia with Lewy
   bodies, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. We demonstrate
   disease-associated ANK1 hypermethylation in the entorhinal cortex in
   Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease,
   whereas in donors with Vascular dementia and Dementia with Lewy bodies,
   we observed elevated ANK1 DNA methylation only in individuals with
   coexisting Alzheimer's disease pathology. We did not observe any
   disease-associated differential ANK1 DNA methylation in the striatum in
   Huntington's disease or the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. Our
   data suggest that ANK1 is characterized by region and disease-specific
   differential DNA methylation in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. (C)

Title = {Association of NIPA1 repeat expansions with amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis in a large international cohort},
Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {74},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {NIPA1 (nonimprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1) mutations are
   known to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia type 6, a neurodegenerative
   disease that phenotypically overlaps to some extent with amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS). Previously, a genomewide screen for copy number
   variants found an association with rare deletions in NIPA1 and ALS, and
   subsequent genetic analyses revealed that long (or expanded) polyalanine
   repeats in NIPA1 convey increased ALS susceptibility. We set out to
   perform a large-scale replication study to further investigate the role
   of NIPA1 polyalanine expansions with ALS, in which we characterized
   NIPA1 repeat size in an independent international cohort of 3955
   patients with ALS and 2276 unaffected controls and combined our results
   with previous reports. Meta-analysis on a total of 6245 patients with
   ALS and 5051 controls showed an overall increased risk of ALS in those
   with expanded (>8) GCG repeat length (odds ratio = 1.50, p =
   3.8x10(-5)). Together with previous reports, these findings provide
   evidence for an association of an expanded polyalanine repeat in NIPA1
   and ALS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Genetic risk variants for brain disorders are enriched in cortical
   H3K27ac domains},
Journal = {MOLECULAR BRAIN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Most variants associated with complex phenotypes in genome-wide
   association studies (GWAS) do not directly index coding changes
   affecting protein structure. Instead they are hypothesized to influence
   gene regulation, with common variants associated with disease being
   enriched in regulatory domains including enhancers and regions of open
   chromatin. There is interest, therefore, in using epigenomic annotation
   data to identify the specific regulatory mechanisms involved and
   prioritize risk variants. We quantified lysine H3K27 acetylation
   (H3K27ac) - a robust mark of active enhancers and promoters that is
   strongly correlated with gene expression and transcription factor
   binding - across the genome in entorhinal cortex samples using chromatin
   immunoprecipitation followed by highly parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq).
   H3K27ac peaks were called using high quality reads combined across all
   samples and formed the basis of partitioned heritability analysis using
   LD score regression along with publicly-available GWAS results for seven
   psychiatric and neurodegenerative traits. Heritability for all seven
   brain traits was significantly enriched in these H3K27ac peaks
   (enrichment ranging from 1.09-2.13) compared to regions of the genome
   containing other active regulatory and functional elements across
   multiple cell types and tissues. The strongest enrichments were for
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (enrichment = 2.19; 95\% CI =
   2.12-2.27), autism (enrichment = 2.11; 95\% CI = 2.05-2.16) and major
   depressive disorder (enrichment = 2.04; 95\% CI = 1.92-2.16). Much lower
   enrichments were observed for 14 non-brain disorders, although we
   identified enrichment in cortical H3K27ac domains for body mass index
   (enrichment = 1.16; 95\% CI = 1.13-1.19), ever smoked (enrichment =
   2.07; 95\% CI = 2.04-2.10), HDL (enrichment = 1.53; 95\% CI = 1.45-1.62)
   and trigylcerides (enrichment = 1.33; 95\% CI = 1.24-1.42). These
   results indicate that risk alleles for brain disorders are
   preferentially located in regions of regulatory/enhancer function in the
   cortex, further supporting the hypothesis that genetic variants for
   these phenotypes influence gene regulation in the brain.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that
   is hypothesized to involve epigenetic dysregulation of gene expression
   in the brain.
   Methods: We performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify
   differential DNA methylation associated with neuropathology in
   prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus samples from 147
   individuals, replicating our findings in two independent data sets (N =
   117 and 740).
   Results: We identify elevated DNA methylation associated with
   neuropathology across a 48-kb region spanning 208 CpG sites within the
   HOXA gene cluster. A meta-analysis of the top-ranked probe within the
   HOXA3 gene (cg22962123) highlighted significant hypermethylation across
   all three cohorts (P = 3.11 X 10(-18)).
   Discussion: We present robust evidence for elevated DNA methylation
   associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology spanning the HOXA
   gene cluster on chromosome 7. These data add to the growing evidence
   highlighting a role for epigenetic variation in Alzheimer's disease,
   implicating the HOX gene family as a target for future investigation.

Abstract = {Background: Genetic influences on gene expression in the human fetal
   brain plausibly impact upon a variety of postnatal brain-related traits,
   including susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. However, to
   date, there have been no studies that have mapped genome-wide expression
   quantitative trait loci (eQTL) specifically in the human prenatal brain.
   Results: We performed deep RNA sequencing and genome-wide genotyping on
   a unique collection of 120 human brains from the second trimester of
   gestation to provide the first eQTL dataset derived exclusively from the
   human fetal brain. We identify high confidence cis-acting eQTL at the
   individual transcript as well as whole gene level, including many
   mapping to a common inversion polymorphism on chromosome 17q21. Fetal
   brain eQTL are enriched among risk variants for postnatal conditions
   including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and
   bipolar disorder. We further identify changes in gene expression within
   the prenatal brain that potentially mediate risk for neuropsychiatric
   traits, including increased expression of C4A in association with
   genetic risk for schizophrenia, increased expression of LRRC57 in
   association with genetic risk for bipolar disorder, and altered
   expression of multiple genes within the chromosome 17q21 inversion in
   association with variants influencing the personality trait of
   neuroticism.
   Conclusions: We have mapped eQTL operating in the human fetal brain,
   providing evidence that these confer risk to certain neuropsychiatric
   disorders, and identifying gene expression changes that potentially
   mediate susceptibility to these conditions.},

Abstract = {Characterizing the complex relationship between genetic, epigenetic, and
   transcriptomic variation has the potential to increase understanding
   about the mechanisms underpinning health and disease phenotypes. We
   undertook a comprehensive analysis of common genetic variation on DNA
   methylation (DNAm) by using the Illumina EPIC array to profile samples
   from the UK Household Longitudinal study. We identified 12,689,548
   significant DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) associations
   (p < 6.52 x 10(-14)) occurring between 2,907,234 genetic variants and
   93,268 DNAm sites, including a large number not identified by previous
   DNAm-profiling methods. We demonstrate the utility of these data for
   interpreting the functional consequences of common genetic variation
   associated with > 60 human traits by using summary-data-based Mendelian
   randomization (SMR) to identify 1,662 pleiotropic associations between
   36 complex traits and 1,246 DNAm sites. We also use SMR to characterize
   the relationship between DNAm and gene expression and thereby identify
   6,798 pleiotropic associations between 5,420 DNAm sites and the
   transcription of 1,702 genes. Our mQTL database and SMR results are
   available via a searchable online database as a resource to the research
   community.},

Abstract = {Cognitive functions are important correlates of health outcomes across
   the life-course. Individual differences in cognitive functions are
   partly heritable. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are
   susceptible to both genetic and environmental factors and may provide
   insights into individual differences in cognitive functions.
   Epigenome-wide meta-analyses for blood-based DNA methylation levels at
   similar to 420,000 CpG sites were performed for seven measures of
   cognitive functioning using data from 11 cohorts. CpGs that passed a
   Bonferroni correction, adjusting for the number of CpGs and cognitive
   tests, were assessed for: longitudinal change; being under genetic
   control (methylation QTLs); and associations with brain health
   (structural MRI), brain methylation and Alzheimer's disease pathology.
   Across the seven measures of cognitive functioning (meta-analysis n
   range: 2557-6809), there were epigenome-wide significant (P < 1.7 x
   10(-8)) associations for global cognitive function (cg21450381, P = 1.6
   x 10(-8)), and phonemic verbal fluency (cg12507869, P = 2.5 x 10(-9)).
   The CpGs are located in an intergenic region on chromosome 12 and the
   INPP5A gene on chromosome 10, respectively. Both probes have moderate
   correlations (similar to 0.4) with brain methylation in Brodmann area 20
   (ventral temporal cortex). Neither probe showed evidence of longitudinal
   change in late-life or associations with white matter brain MRI measures
   in one cohort with these data. A methylation QTL analysis suggested that
   rs113565688 was a cis methylation QTL for cg12507869 (P = 5 x 10(-5) and
   4 x 10(-13) in two lookup cohorts). We demonstrate a link between
   blood-based DNA methylation and measures of phonemic verbal fluency and
   global cognitive ability. Further research is warranted to understand
   the mechanisms linking genomic regulatory changes with cognitive
   function to health and disease.},

Abstract = {We quantified genome-wide patterns of lysine H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac)
   in entorhinal cortex samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and
   matched controls using chromatin immunoprecipitation and highly parallel
   sequencing. We observed widespread acetylomic variation associated with
   AD neuropathology, identifying 4,162 differential peaks (false discovery
   rate < 0.05) between AD cases and controls. Differentially acetylated
   peaks were enriched in disease-related biological pathways and included
   regions annotated to genes involved in the progression of amyloid-beta
   and tau pathology (for example, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and MAPT), as well as
   regions containing variants associated with sporadic late-onset AD.
   Partitioned heritability analysis highlighted a highly significant
   enrichment of AD risk variants in entorhinal cortex H3K27ac peak
   regions. AD-associated variable H3K27ac was associated with
   transcriptional variation at proximal genes including CR1, GPR22, KMO,
   PIM3, PSEN1, and RGCC. In addition to identifying molecular pathways
   associated with AD neuropathology, we present a framework for
   genome-wide studies of histone modifications in complex disease.},

Title = {Autosomal genetic variation is associated with DNA methylation in
   regions variably escaping X-chromosome inactivation},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), i.e., the inactivation of one of the
   female X chromosomes, restores equal expression of X-chromosomal genes
   between females and males. However, similar to 10\% of genes show
   variable degrees of escape from XCI between females, although little is
   known about the causes of variable XCI. Using a discovery data-set of
   1867 females and 1398 males and a replication sample of 3351 females, we
   show that genetic variation at three autosomal loci is associated with
   female-specific changes in X-chromosome methylation. Through cis-eQTL
   expression analysis, we map these loci to the genes SMCHD1/METTL4,
   TRIM6/HBG2, and ZSCAN9. Low-expression alleles of the loci are
   predominantly associated with mild hypomethylation of CpG islands near
   genes known to variably escape XCI, implicating the autosomal genes in
   variable XCI. Together, these results suggest a genetic basis for
   variable escape from XCI and highlight the potential of a population
   genomics approach to identify genes involved in XCI.},

Abstract = {Depression is a common and disabling disorder, representing a major
   social and economic health issue. Moreover, depression is associated
   with the progression of diseases with an inflammatory etiology including
   many inflammatory related disorders. At the molecular level, the
   mechanisms by which depression might promote the onset of these diseases
   and associated immune-dysfunction are not well understood. In this study
   we assessed genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in whole
   blood-derived DNA obtained from individuals with a self-reported history
   of depression (n = 100) and individuals without a history of depression
   (n = 100) using the Illumine 450K microarray. Our analysis identified
   six significant (Sidak corrected P < 0.05) depression-associated
   differentially methylated regions (DMRs); the top-ranked DMR was located
   in exon 1 of the LTB4R2 gene (Sidel corrected P = 1.27 x 10(-14)).
   Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression were generated and known
   biological markers of inflammation, telomere length (TL) and IL-6, were
   measured in DNA and serum samples, respectively. Next, we employed a
   systems-level approach to identify networks of co-methylated loci
   associated with a history of depression, in addition to depression PRS,
   TL and IL-6 levels. Our analysis identified one depression-associated
   co-methylation module (P = 0.04). Interestingly, the
   depression-associated module was highly enriched for pathways related to
   immune function and was also associated with TL and IL-6 cytokine
   levels. In summary, our genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of
   individuals with and without a self-reported history of depression
   identified several candidate DMRs of potential relevance to the
   pathogenesis of depression and its associated immune-dysfunction
   phenotype.},

Abstract = {Variation in DNA methylation is being increasingly associated with
   health and disease outcomes. Although DNA methylation is hypothesized to
   be a mechanism by which both genetic and non-genetic factors can
   influence the regulation of gene expression, little is known about the
   extent to which DNA methylation at specific sites is influenced by
   heritable as well as environmental factors. We quantified DNA
   methylation in whole blood at age 18 in a birth cohort of 1,464
   individuals comprising 426 monozygotic (MZ) and 306 same-sex dizygotic
   (DZ) twin pairs. Site-specific levels of DNA methylation were more
   strongly correlated across the genome between MZ than DZ twins.
   Structural equation models revealed that although the average
   contribution of additive genetic influences on DNA methylation across
   the genome was relatively low, it was notably elevated at the highly
   variable sites characterized by intermediate levels of DNAm that are
   most relevant for epigenetic epidemiology. Sites at which variable DNA
   methylation was most influenced by genetic factors were significantly
   enriched for DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) effects, and
   overlapped with sites where inter-individual variation correlates across
   tissues. Finally, we show that DNA methylation at sites robustly
   associated with environmental exposures such as tobacco smoking and
   obesity is also influenced by additive genetic effects, highlighting the
   need to control for genetic background in analyses of
   exposure-associated DNA methylation differences. Estimates of the
   contribution of genetic and environmental influences to DNA methylation

Title = {Genome-wide methylomic analysis in individuals with HNF1B intragenic
   mutation and 17q12 microdeletion},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIGENETICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Heterozygous mutation of the transcription factor HNF1B is the most
   common cause of monogenetic developmental renal disease.
   Disease-associated mutations fall into two categories: HNF1B intragenic
   mutations and a 1.3 Mb deletion at chromosome 17q12. An increase in
   neurodevelopmental disorders has been observed in individuals harbouring
   the 17q12 deletion but not in patients with HNF1B coding mutations.
   Previous investigations have concentrated on identifying a genetic cause
   for the increase in behavioural problems seen in 17q12 deletion
   carriers. We have taken the alternative approach of investigating the
   DNA methylation profile of these two HNF1B genotype groups along with
   controls matched for age, gender and diabetes status using the Illumina
   450K DNA methylation array (total sample n = 60).
   We identified a number of differentially methylated probes (DMPs) that
   were associated with HNF1B-associated disease and passed our stringent
   experiment-wide significance threshold. These associations were largely
   driven by the deletion patients and the majority of the significant
   probes mapped to the 17q12 deletion locus. The observed changes in DNA
   methylation at this locus were not randomly dispersed and occurred in
   clusters, suggesting a regulatory mechanism reacting to
   haploinsufficiency across the entire deleted region.
   Along with these deletion-specific changes in DNA methylation, we also
   identified a shared DNA methylation signature in both mutation and
   deletion patient groups indicating that haploinsufficiency of HNF1B
   impacts on the methylome of a number of genes, giving further insight to
   the role of HNF1B.},

Title = {Prenatal immune activation alters the adult neural epigenome but can be
   partly stabilised by a n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid diet},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {An unstable epigenome is implicated in the pathophysiology of
   neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. This is
   important because the epigenome is potentially modifiable. We have
   previously reported that adult offspring exposed to maternal immune
   activation (MIA) prenatally have significant global DNA hypomethylation
   in the hypothalamus. However, what genes had altered methylation state,
   their functional effects on gene expression and whether these changes
   can be moderated, have not been addressed. In this study, we used
   next-generation sequencing (NGS) for methylome profiling in a MIA rodent
   model of neurodevelopmental disorders. We assessed whether
   differentially methylated regions (DMRs) affected the chromatin state by
   mapping known DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs), and selected
   overlapping genes to confirm a functional effect of MIA on gene
   expression using qPCR. Finally, we tested whether methylation
   differences elicited by MIA could be limited by post-natal dietary
   (omega) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation. These
   experiments were conducted using hypothalamic brain tissue from
   12-week-old offspring of mice injected with viral analogue PolyI:C on
   gestation day 9 of pregnancy or saline on gestation day 9. Half of the
   animals from each group were fed a diet enriched with n-3 PUFA from
   weaning (MIA group, n = 12 units, n = 39 mice; Control group, n = 12
   units, n = 38 mice). The results confirmed our previous finding that
   adult offspring exposed to MIA prenatally had significant global DNA
   hypomethylation. Furthermore, genes linked to synaptic plasticity were
   over-represented among differentially methylated genes following MIA.
   More than 80\% of MIA-induced hypomethylated sites, including those
   affecting chromatin state and MECP2 binding, were stabilised by the n-3
   PUFA intervention. MIA resulted in increased expression of two of the
   `top five' genes identified from an integrated analysis of DMRs, DHSs
   and MECP2 binding sites, namely Abat (t = 2.46, p < 0.02) and Gnas9 (t =
   2.96, p < 0.01), although these changes were not stabilised by dietary
   intervention. Thus, prenatal MIA exposure impacts upon the epigenomic
   regulation of gene pathways linked to neurodevelopmental conditions; and
   many of the changes can be attenuated by a low-cost dietary
   intervention.},

Title = {Analysis of DNA Methylation in Young People: Limited Evidence for an
   Association Between Victimization Stress and Epigenetic Variation in
   Blood},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {175},
Number = {6},
Pages = {517-529},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective: DNA methylation has been proposed as an epigenetic mechanism
   by which early-life experiences become ``embedded{''} in the genome and
   alter transcriptional processes to compromise health. The authors sought
   to investigate whether early-life victimization stress is associated
   with genome-wide DNA methylation.
   Method: The authors tested the hypothesis that victimization is
   associated with DNA methylation in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk)
   Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative 1994-1995 birth cohort
   of 2,232 twins born in England and Wales and assessed at ages 5, 7, 10,
   12, and 18 years. Multiple forms of victimization were ascertained in
   childhood and adolescence (including physical, sexual, and emotional
   abuse; neglect; exposure to intimate-partner violence; bullying;
   cyber-victimization; and crime).
   Results: Epigenome-wide analyses of polyvictimization across childhood
   and adolescence revealed few significant associations with DNA
   methylation in peripheral blood at age 18, but these analyses were
   confounded by tobacco smoking and/or did not survive co-twin control
   tests. Secondary analyses of specific forms of victimization revealed
   sparse associations with DNA methylation that did not replicate across
   different operationalizations of the same putative victimization
   experience. Hypothesis-driven analyses of six candidate genes in the
   stress response (NR3C1, FKBP5, BDNF, AVP, CRHR1, SLC6A4) did not reveal
   predicted associations with DNA methylation in probes annotated to these
   genes.
   Conclusions: Findings from this epidemiological analysis of the
   epigenetic effects of early-life stress do not support the hypothesis of
   robust changes in DNA methylation in victimized young people. We need to
   come to terms with the possibility that epigenetic epidemiology is not
   yet well matched to experimental, nonhuman models in uncovering the
   biological embedding of stress.},

Abstract = {Aim: The present study investigated the link between peripheral DNA
   methylation (DNAm), cognitive impairment and brain aging. Methods: We
   tested the association between blood genome-wide DNAm profiles using the
   Illumina 450K arrays, cognitive dysfunction and brain MRI measures in
   selected participants of the Whitehall II imaging sub-study. Results:
   Eight differentially methylated regions were associated with cognitive
   impairment. Accelerated aging based on the Hannum epigenetic clock was
   associated with mean diffusivity and global fractional anisotropy. We
   also identified modules of co-methylated loci associated with white
   matter hyperintensities. These co-methylation modules were enriched
   among pathways relevant to beta-amyloid processing and glutamatergic
   signaling. Conclusion: Our data support the notion that blood DNAm
   changes may have utility as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction and
   brain aging.},

Abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common illness accompanied by
   considerable morbidity, mortality, costs, and heightened risk of
   suicide. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis based in
   135,458 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44 independent and
   significant loci. The genetic findings were associated with clinical
   features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting
   anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications
   and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller
   association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for
   major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and
   schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were
   putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected
   a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater
   numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings
   help refine the basis of major depression and imply that a continuous
   measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.},

Title = {Elevated polygenic burden for autism is associated with differential DNA
   methylation at birth},
Journal = {GENOME MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe
   neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social
   communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, interests, or
   activities. The etiology of ASD involves both inherited and
   environmental risk factors, with epigenetic processes hypothesized as
   one mechanism by which both genetic and non-genetic variation influence
   gene regulation and pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify
   DNA methylation biomarkers of ASD detectable at birth.
   Methods: We quantified neonatal methylomic variation in 1263 infants-of
   whom similar to 50\% went on to subsequently develop ASD-using DNA
   isolated from archived blood spots taken shortly after birth. We used
   matched genotype data from the same individuals to examine the molecular
   consequences of ASD-associated genetic risk variants, identifying
   methylomic variation associated with elevated polygenic burden for ASD.
   In addition, we performed DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL)
   mapping to prioritize target genes from ASD GWAS findings.
   Results: We identified robust epigenetic signatures of gestational age
   and prenatal tobacco exposure, confirming the utility of DNA methylation
   data generated from neonatal blood spots. Although we did not identify
   specific loci showing robust differences in neonatal DNA methylation
   associated with later ASD, there was a significant association between
   increased polygenic burden for autism and methylomic variation at
   specific loci. Each unit of elevated ASD polygenic risk score was
   associated with a mean increase in DNA methylation of -0.14\% at two CpG
   sites located proximal to a robust GWAS signal for ASD on chromosome 8.
   Conclusions: This study is the largest analysis of DNA methylation in
   ASD undertaken and the first to integrate genetic and epigenetic
   variation at birth. We demonstrate the utility of using a polygenic risk
   score to identify molecular variation associated with disease, and of
   using mQTL to refine the functional and regulatory variation associated
   with ASD risk variants.},

Title = {5-hydroxymethylcytosine is highly dynamic across human fetal brain
   development},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Background: Epigenetic processes play a key role in orchestrating
   transcriptional regulation during the development of the human central
   nervous system. We previously described dynamic changes in DNA
   methylation (5mC) occurring during human fetal brain development, but
   other epigenetic processes operating during this period have not been
   extensively explored. Of particular interest is DNA hydroxymethylation
   (5hmC), a modification that is enriched in the human brain and
   hypothesized to play an important role in neuronal function, learning
   and memory. In this study, we quantify 5hmC across the genome of 71
   human fetal brain samples spanning 23 to 184 days post-conception.
   Results: We identify widespread changes in 5hmC occurring during human
   brain development, notable sex-differences in 5hmC in the fetal brain,
   and interactions between 5mC and 5hmC at specific sites. Finally, we
   identify loci where 5hmC in the fetal brain is associated with genetic
   variation.
   Conclusions: This study represents the first systematic analysis of
   dynamic changes in 5hmC across human neurodevelopment and highlights the
   potential importance of this modification in the human brain.},

Abstract = {Recent epigenetic association studies have identified a new gene, ANK1,
   in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although strong
   associations were observed, brain homogenates were used to generate the
   data, introducing complications because of the range of cell types
   analyzed. In order to address the issue of cellular heterogeneity in
   homogenate samples we isolated microglial, astrocytes and neurons by
   laser capture microdissection from CA1 of hippocampus in the same
   individuals with a clinical and pathological diagnosis of AD and matched
   control cases. Using this unique RNAseq data set, we show that in the
   hippocampus, ANK1 is significantly (p<0.0001) up-regulated 4-fold in AD
   microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes from the same individuals.
   These data provide evidence that microglia are the source of ANK1
   differential expression previously identified in homogenate samples in
   AD.},

   Methylation: Utility for Refining GWAS Loci},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {100},
Number = {6},
Pages = {954-959},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Most genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies
   (GWASs) of complex traits are thought to act by affecting gene
   regulation rather than directly altering the protein product. As a
   consequence, the actual genes involved in disease are not necessarily
   the most proximal to the associated variants. By integrating data from
   GWAS analyses with those from genetic studies of regulatory variation,
   it is possible to identify variants pleiotropically associated with both
   a complex trait and measures of gene regulation. In this study, we used
   summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR), a method developed to
   identify variants pleiotropically associated with both complex traits
   and gene expression, to identify variants associated with complex traits
   and DNA methylation. We used large DNA methylation quantitative trait
   locus (mQTL) datasets generated from two different tissues (blood and
   fetal brain) to prioritize genes for >40 complex traits with robust GWAS
   data and found considerable overlap with the results of SMR analyses
   performed with expression QTL (eQTL) data. We identified multiple
   examples of variable DNA methylation associated with GWAS variants for a
   range of complex traits, demonstrating the utility of this approach for
   refining genetic association signals.},

Title = {Genetic architecture of epigenetic and neuronal ageing rates in human

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Identifying genes regulating the pace of epigenetic ageing represents a
   new frontier in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Here using
   1,796 brain samples from 1,163 individuals, we carry out a GWAS of two
   DNA methylation-based biomarkers of brain age: the epigenetic ageing
   rate and estimated proportion of neurons. Locus 17q11.2 is significantly
   associated (P = 4.5 x 10(-9)) with the ageing rate across five brain
   regions and harbours a cis-expression quantitative trait locus for
   EFCAB5 (P = 3.4 x 10(-20)). Locus 1p36.12 is significantly associated (P
   = 2.2 x 10(-8)) with epigenetic ageing of the prefrontal cortex,
   independent of the proportion of neurons. Our GWAS of the proportion of
   neurons identified two genome-wide significant loci (10q26 and 12p13.31)
   and resulted in a gene set that overlaps significantly with sets found
   by GWAS of age-related macular degeneration (P = 1.4 x 10(-12)),
   ulcerative colitis (P < 1.0 x 10(-20)), type 2 diabetes (P = 2.8 x
   10(-13)), hip/waist circumference in men (P = 1.1 x 10(-9)),
   schizophrenia (P = 1.6 x 10(-9)), cognitive decline (P = 5.3 x 10(-4))

Title = {Regional differences in mitochondrial DNA methylation in human
   post-mortem brain tissue},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIGENETICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Background: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism
   involved in gene regulation, with alterations in DNA methylation in the
   nuclear genome being linked to numerous complex diseases. Mitochondrial
   DNA methylation is a phenomenon that is receiving ever-increasing
   interest, particularly in diseases characterized by mitochondrial
   dysfunction; however, most studies have been limited to the
   investigation of specific target regions. Analyses spanning the entire
   mitochondrial genome have been limited, potentially due to the amount of
   input DNA required. Further, mitochondrial genetic studies have been
   previously confounded by nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes. Methylated
   DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing is a technique widely used to profile
   DNA methylation across the nuclear genome; however, reads mapped to
   mitochondrial DNA are often discarded. Here, we have developed an
   approach to control for nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes within
   Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing data. We highlight the
   utility of this approach in identifying differences in mitochondrial DNA
   methylation across regions of the human brain and pre-mortem blood.
   Results: We were able to correlate mitochondrial DNA methylation
   patterns between the cortex, cerebellum and blood. We identified 74
   nominally significant differentially methylated regions (p < 0.05) in
   the mitochondrial genome, between anatomically separate cortical regions
   and the cerebellum in matched samples (N = 3 matched donors). Further
   analysis identified eight significant differentially methylated regions
   between the total cortex and cerebellum after correcting for multiple
   testing. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the
   mitochondrial DNA methylome, we were able to identify tissue-specific
   patterns of mitochondrial DNA methylation between blood, cerebellum and
   cortex.
   Conclusions: Our study represents a comprehensive analysis of the
   mitochondrial methylome using pre-existing Methylated DNA
   Immunoprecipitation Sequencing data to identify brain region-specific
   patterns of mitochondrial DNA methylation.},

Abstract = {Objective: Advanced paternal age (APA) at conception has been linked
   with autism and schizophrenia in offspring, neurodevelopmental disorders
   that affect social functioning. The current study explored the effects
   of paternal age on social development in the general population.
   Method: We used multilevel growth modeling to investigate APA effects on
   socioemotional development from early childhood until adolescence, as
   measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in the
   Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) sample. We also investigated
   genetic and environmental underpinnings of the paternal age effects on
   development, using the Additive genetics, Common environment, unique
   Environment (ACE) and gene environment (GxE) models.
   Results: In the general population, both very young and advanced
   paternal ages were associated with altered trajectory of social
   development (intercept: p = .01; slope: p = .03). No other behavioral
   domain was affected by either young or advanced age at fatherhood,
   suggesting specificity of paternal age effects. Increased importance of
   genetic factors in social development was recorded in the offspring of
   older but not very young fathers, suggesting distinct underpinnings of
   the paternal age effects at these two extremes.
   Conclusion: Our findings highlight that the APA-related deficits that
   lead to autism and schizophrenia are likely continuously distributed in
   the population.},

Abstract = {Objective: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful
   at identifying associations with stroke and stroke subtypes, but have
   not yet identified any associations solely with small vessel stroke
   (SVS). SVS comprises one quarter of all ischemic stroke and is a major
   manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, the primary cause of
   vascular cognitive impairment. Studies across neurological traits have
   shown that younger-onset cases have an increased genetic burden. We
   leveraged this increased genetic burden by performing an age-at-onset
   informed GWAS metaanalysis, including a large younger-onset SVS
   population, to identify novel associations with stroke.
   Methods: We used a three-stage age-at-onset informed GWAS to identify
   novel genetic variants associated with stroke. On identifying a novel
   locus associated with SVS, we assessed its influence on other small
   vessel disease phenotypes, as well as on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression
   of nearby genes, and on DNA methylation of nearby CpG sites in whole
   blood and in the fetal brain.
   Results: We identified an association with SVS in 4,203 cases and 50,728
   controls on chromosome 16q24.2 (odds ratio {[}OR; 95\% confidence
   interval \{CI\}] = 1.16 {[}1.10-1.22]; p=3.2x10(-9)). The lead
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs12445022) was also associated with
   cerebral white matter hyperintensities (OR {[}95\% CI] = 1.10
   {[}1.05-1.16]; p=5.3x10(-5); N=3,670), but not intracerebral hemorrhage
   (OR {[}95\% CI] 50.97 {[}0.84-1.12]; p=0.71; 1,545 cases, 1,481
   controls). rs12445022 is associated with mRNA expression of ZCCHC14 in
   arterial tissues (p=9.4x10(-7)) and DNA methylation at probe cg16596957
   in whole blood (p=5.3x10(-6)).
   Interpretation: 16q24.2 is associated with SVS. Associations of the
   locus with expression of ZCCHC14 and DNA methylation suggest the locus
   acts through changes to regulatory elements.},

Title = {Is treatment-resistant schizophrenia categorically distinct from
   treatment-responsive schizophrenia? a systematic review},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a highly heterogeneous disorder, and around
   a third of patients are treatment-resistant. The only evidence-based
   treatment for these patients is clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic
   with relatively weak dopamine antagonism. It is plausible that varying
   degrees of response to antipsychotics reflect categorically distinct
   illness subtypes, which would have significant implications for research
   and clinical practice. If these subtypes could be distinguished at
   illness onset, this could represent a first step towards personalised
   medicine in psychiatry. This systematic review investigates whether
   current evidence supports conceptualising treatment-resistant and
   treatment-responsive schizophrenoa as categorically distinct subtypes.
   Method: A systematic literature search was conducted, using PubMed,
   EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL and OpenGrey databases, to identify all studies
   which compared treatment-resistant schizophrenia (defined as either a
   lack of response to two antipsychotic trials or clozapine prescription)
   to treatment-responsive schizophrenia (defined as known response to
   non-clozapine antipsychotics).
   Results: Nineteen studies of moderate quality met inclusion criteria.
   The most robust findings indicate that treatment-resistant patients show
   glutamatergic abnormalities, a lack of dopaminergic abnormalities, and
   significant decreases in grey matter compared to treatment-responsive
   patients. Treatment-resistant patients were also reported to have higher
   familial loading; however, no individual gene-association study reported
   their findings surviving correction for multiple comparisons.
   Conclusions: Tentative evidence supports conceptualising
   treatment-resistant schizophrenia as a categorically different illness
   subtype to treatment-responsive schizophrenia. However, research is
   limited and confirmation will require replication and rigorously
   controlled studies with large sample sizes and prospective study
   designs.},

Abstract = {Background: Although glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the hippocampus
   play a vital role in the regulation of physiological and behavioural
   responses to stress, the regulation of receptor expression remains
   unclear. This work investigates the molecular mechanisms underpinning
   stress-induced changes in hippocampal GR mRNA levels in vivo. Methods:
   Male Wistar rats were killed either under baseline conditions or after
   forced swim stress (FSS; 15 min in 25 degrees C water). Rat hippocampi
   were micro-dissected (for mRNA, microRNA, and DNA methylation analysis)
   or frozen whole (for chromatin immunoprecipitation). In an additional
   experiment, rats were pre-treated with RU486 (a GR antagonist) or
   vehicle. Results: FSS evoked a dentate gyrus-specific reduction in GR
   mRNA levels. This was related to an increased DNMT3a protein association
   with a discreet region of the Nr3c1 (GR gene) promoter, shown here to
   undergo increased DNA methylation after FSS. FSS also caused a
   time-dependent increase in the expression of miR-124a, a microRNA known
   to reduce GR mRNA expression, which was inversely correlated with a
   reduction in GR mRNA levels 30 min after FSS. FSS did not affect GR
   binding to a putative negative glucocorticoid response element within
   the Nr3c1 gene. Conclusions: Acute stress results in decreased GR mRNA
   expression specifically in the dentate gyrus. Our results indicate that
   a complex interplay of multiple molecular mechanisms - including
   increased DNA methylation of discrete CpG residues within the Nr3c1
   gene, most likely facilitated by DNMT3a, and increased expression of
   miR-124a - could be responsible for these changes. (C) 2016 S. Karger

Abstract = {Genetic association studies provide evidence for a substantial polygenic
   component to schizophrenia, although the neurobiological mechanisms
   underlying the disorder remain largely undefined. Building on recent
   studies supporting a role for developmentally regulated epigenetic
   variation in the molecular aetiology of schizophrenia, this study aimed
   to identify epigenetic variation associated with both a diagnosis of
   schizophrenia and elevated polygenic risk burden for the disease across
   multiple brain regions. Genome-wide DNA methylation was quantified in
   262 post-mortem brain samples, representing tissue from four brain
   regions (prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum) from
   41 schizophrenia patients and 47 controls. We identified multiple
   disease-associated and polygenic risk score-associated differentially
   methylated positions and regions, which are not enriched in genomic
   regions identified in genetic studies of schizophrenia and do not
   reflect direct genetic effects on DNA methylation. Our study represents
   the first analysis of epigenetic variation associated with schizophrenia
   across multiple brain regions and highlights the utility of polygenic
   risk scores for identifying molecular pathways associated with
   aetiological variation in complex disease.},

Abstract = {Childhood maltreatment is a key risk factor for poor mental and physical
   health. Recently, variation in epigenetic processes, such as DNA
   methylation, has emerged as a potential pathway mediating this
   association; yet, the extent to which different forms of maltreatment
   may be characterized by unique vs shared epigenetic signatures is
   currently unknown. In this study, we quantified DNA methylation across
   the genome in buccal epithelial cell samples from a high-risk sample of
   inner-city youth (n = 124; age = 16-24; 53\% female), 68\% of whom
   reported experiencing at least one form of maltreatment while growing
   up. Our analyses aimed to identify methylomic variation associated with
   exposure to five major types of childhood maltreatment. We found that:
   (i) maltreatment types differ in the extent to which they associate with
   methylomic variation, with physical exposures showing the strongest
   associations; (ii) many of the identified loci are annotated to genes
   previously implicated in stress-related outcomes, including psychiatric
   and physical disorders (e.g. GABBR1, GRIN2D, CACNA2D4, PSEN2); and (iii)
   based on gene ontology analyses, maltreatment types not only show unique
   methylation patterns enriched for specific biological processes (e.g.
   physical abuse and cardiovascular function), but also share a `common'
   epigenetic signature enriched for biological processes related to neural
   development and organismal growth. A stringent set of sensitivity
   analyses were also run to identify high-confidence associations.
   Together, findings lend novel insights into epigenetic signatures of
   childhood abuse and neglect, point to novel potential biomarkers for
   future investigation and support a molecular link between maltreatment
   and poor health outcomes. Nevertheless, it will be important in future
   to replicate findings, as the use of cross-sectional data and high rates
   of polyvictimization in our study make it difficult to fully disentangle
   the shared vs unique epigenetic signatures of maltreatment types.
   Furthermore, studies will be needed to test the role of potential
   moderators in the identified associations, including age of onset and
   chronicity of maltreatment exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The association of histone modification changes with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) has not been systematically examined. We conducted a
   histone acetylome-wide association study (HAWAS) by performing H3K27ac
   chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on 257 postmortem
   samples from ASD and matched control brains. Despite etiological
   heterogeneity, >= 68\% of syndromic and idiopathic ASD cases shared a
   common acetylome signature at >5,000 cis-regulatory elements in
   prefrontal and temporal cortex. Similarly, multiple genes associated
   with rare genetic mutations in ASD showed common ``epi-mutations.''
   Acetylome aberrations in ASD were not attributable to genetic
   differentiation at cis-SNPs and highlighted genes involved in synaptic
   transmission, ion transport, epilepsy, behavioral abnormality,
   chemokinesis, histone deacetylation, and immunity. By correlating
   histone acetylation with genotype, we discovered >2,000 histone
   acetylation quantitative trait loci (haQTLs) in human brain regions,
   including four candidate causal variants for psychiatric diseases. Due
   to the relative stability of histone modifications postmortem, we
   anticipate that the HAWAS approach will be applicable to multiple

Abstract = {Although mutations within the TREM2 gene have been robustly associated
   with Alzheimer's disease, it is not known whether alterations in the
   regulation of this gene are also involved in pathogenesis. Here, we
   present data demonstrating increased DNA methylation in the superior
   temporal gyrus in Alzheimer's disease brain at a CpG site located 289 bp
   upstream of the transcription start site of the TREM2 gene in 3
   independent study cohorts using 2 different technologies (Illumina
   Infinium 450K methylation beadchip and pyrosequencing). A meta-analysis
   across all 3 cohorts reveals consistent AD-associated hyper-methylation
   (p = 3.47E-08). This study highlights that extending genetic studies of
   TREM2 in AD to investigate epigenetic changes may nominate additional
   mechanisms by which disruption to this gene increases risk. (C) 2016

   profiled isolated clonal neural stem cells, observing that significant
   random allelic expression imbalance is reestablished at 0.65\% of
   expressed genes, including novel loci not found to show allelic
   expression imbalance in the original parental neural progenitor cells.
   Allelic expression imbalance was associated with altered DNA methylation
   across promoter regulatory regions, with clones characterized by skewed
   allelic expression being hypermethylated compared to their biallelic
   sister clones. Our results suggest that random allelic expression
   imbalance is established during lineage commitment and is associated
   with increased DNA methylation at the gene promoter.},

Title = {Collapsed methylation quantitative trait loci analysis for low frequency

Abstract = {Background: Single variant approaches have been successful in
   identifying DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL), although as
   with complex traits they lack the statistical power to identify the
   effects from rare genetic variants. We have undertaken extensive
   analyses to identify regions of low frequency and rare variants that are
   associated with DNA methylation levels.
   Methods: We used repeated measurements of DNA methylation from five
   different life stages in human blood, taken from the Avon Longitudinal
   Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Variants were collapsed
   across CpG islands and their flanking regions to identify variants
   collectively associated with methylation, where no single variant was
   individually responsible for the observed signal. All analyses were
   undertaken using the sequence kernel association test.
   Results: For loci where no individual variant mQTL was observed based on
   a single variant analysis, we identified 95 unique regions where the
   combined effect of low frequency variants (MAF <= 5\%) provided strong
   evidence of association with methylation. For loci where there was
   previous evidence of an individual variant mQTL, a further 3 regions
   provided evidence of association between multiple low frequency variants
   and methylation levels. Effects were observed consistently across 5
   different time points in the lifecourse and evidence of replication in
   the TwinsUK and Exeter cohorts was also identified.
   Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of this novel approach to
   mQTL analysis by analysing the combined effect of multiple low frequency
   or rare variants. Future studies should benefit from applying this
   approach as a complementary follow up to single variant analyses.},

Title = {An integrated genetic-epigenetic analysis of schizophrenia: evidence for
   co-localization of genetic associations and differential DNA methylation},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a highly heritable, neuropsychiatric
   disorder characterized by episodic psychosis and altered cognitive
   function. Despite success in identifying genetic variants associated
   with schizophrenia, there remains uncertainty about the causal genes
   involved in disease pathogenesis and how their function is regulated.
   Results: We performed a multi-stage epigenome-wide association study,
   quantifying genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in a total of 1714
   individuals from three independent sample cohorts. We have identified
   multiple differentially methylated positions and regions consistently
   associated with schizophrenia across the three cohorts; these effects
   are independent of important confounders such as smoking. We also show
   that epigenetic variation at multiple loci across the genome contributes
   to the polygenic nature of schizophrenia. Finally, we show how DNA
   methylation quantitative trait loci in combination with Bayesian
   co-localization analyses can be used to annotate extended genomic
   regions nominated by studies of schizophrenia, and to identify potential
   regulatory variation causally involved in disease.
   Conclusions: This study represents the first systematic integrated
   analysis of genetic and epigenetic variation in schizophrenia,
   introducing a methodological approach that can be used to inform
   epigenome-wide association study analyses of other complex traits and
   diseases. We demonstrate the utility of using a polygenic risk score to
   identify molecular variation associated with etiological variation, and
   of using DNA methylation quantitative trait loci to refine the
   functional and regulatory variation associated with schizophrenia risk
   variants. Finally, we present strong evidence for the co-localization of
   genetic associations for schizophrenia and differential DNA methylation.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The potential for epigenetic changes in host cells following microbial
   infection has been widely suggested, but few examples have been
   reported. We assessed genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in human
   macrophage-like U937 cells following infection with Burkholderia
   pseudomallei, an intracellular bacterial pathogen and the causative
   agent of human melioidosis. Our analyses revealed significant changes in
   host cell DNA methylation, at multiple CpG sites in the host cell
   genome, following infection. Infection induced differentially methylated
   probes (iDMPs) showing the greatest changes in DNA methylation were
   found to be in the vicinity of genes involved in inflammatory responses,
   intracellular signalling, apoptosis and pathogen-induced signalling. A
   comparison of our data with reported methylome changes in cells infected
   with M. tuberculosis revealed commonality of differentially methylated
   genes, including genes involved in T cell responses (BCL11B, FOXO1,
   KIF13B, PAWR, SOX4, SYK), actin cytoskeleton organisation (ACTR3,
   CDC42BPA, DTNBP1, FERMT2, PRKCZ, RAC1), and cytokine production (FOXP1,
   IRF8, MR1). Overall our findings show that pathogenic-specific and
   pathogen-common changes in the methylome occur following infection.},

Abstract = {The field of mitochondrial epigenetics has received increased attention
   in recent years and changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation has
   been implicated in a number of diseases, including neurodegenerative

   current technologies best suited to capturing mtDNA methylation, and how
   a move towards whole epigenome sequencing of mtDNA may help to advance
   our current understanding of the field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {Stressful events evoke long-term changes in behavioral responses;
   however, the underlying mechanisms in the brain are not well understood.
   Previous work has shown that epigenetic changes and immediate-early gene
   (IEG) induction in stress-activated dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons
   play a crucial role in these behavioral responses. Here, we show that an
   acute stressful challenge {[}i.e., forced swimming (FS)] results in DNA
   demethylation at specific CpG (5'-cytosine-phosphateguanine-3') sites
   close to the c-Fos (FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog)
   transcriptional start site and within the gene promoter region of Egr-1
   (early growth response protein 1) specifically in the DG. Administration
   of the (endogenous) methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) did not
   affect CpG methylation and IEG gene expression at baseline. However,
   administration of SAM before the FS challenge resulted in an enhanced
   CpG methylation at the IEG loci and suppression of IEG induction
   specifically in the DG and an impaired behavioral immobility response 24
   h later. The stressor also specifically increased the expression of the
   de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a {[}DNA
   (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha] in this hippocampus region.
   Moreover, stress resulted in an increased association of Dnmt3a enzyme
   with the affected CpG loci within the IEG genes. No effects of SAM were
   observed on stress-evoked histone modifications, including H3S10p-K14ac
   (histone H3, phosphorylated serine 10 and acetylated lysine-14), H3K4me3
   (histone H3, trimethylated lysine-4), H3K9me3 (histone H3, trimethylated
   lysine-9), and H3K27me3 (histone H3, trimethylated lysine-27). We
   conclude that the DNA methylation status of IEGs plays a crucial role in
   FS-induced IEG induction in DG granule neurons and associated behavioral
   responses. In addition, the concentration of available methyl donor,
   possibly in conjunction with Dnmt3a, is critical for the responsiveness
   of dentate neurons to environmental stimuli in terms of gene expression
   and behavior.},

Title = {Genome-wide DNA methylation levels and altered cortisol stress
   reactivity following childhood trauma in humans},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {DNA methylation likely plays a role in the regulation of human stress
   reactivity. Here we show that in a genome- wide analysis of blood DNA
   methylation in 85 healthy individuals, a locus in the Kit ligand gene
   (KITLG; cg27512205) showed the strongest association with cortisol
   stress reactivity (P = 5.8 x 10 (-6)). Replication was obtained in two
   independent samples using either blood (N = 45, P = 0.001) or buccal
   cells (N = 255, P = 0.004). KITLG methylation strongly mediates the
   relationship between childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity in
   the discovery sample (32\% mediation). Its genomic location, a CpG
   island shore within an H3K27ac enhancer mark, and the correlation
   between methylation in the blood and prefrontal cortex provide further
   evidence that KITLG methylation is functionally relevant for the
   programming of stress reactivity in the human brain. Our results extend
   preclinical evidence for epigenetic regulation of stress reactivity to
   humans and provide leads to enhance our understanding of the

Abstract = {Epigenetic disruption has been implicated in many diseases of aging, and
   age-associated DNA methylation changes at specific genomic loci in
   humans are strongly correlated with chronological age. The aim of this
   study was to explore the specificity of selected age-associated
   differentially methylated positions (aDMPs) identified in human
   epidemiological studies by quantifying DNA methylation across multiple
   tissues in homologous regions of the murine genome. We selected four
   high-confidence aDMPs (located in the vicinity of the ELOVL2, GLRA1,
   MYOD1 and PDE4C genes) and quantified DNA methylation across these
   regions in four tissues (blood, lung, cerebellum and hippocampus) from
   male and female C57BL/6J mice, ranging in age from fetal (embryonic day
   17) to 630 days. We observed tissue-specific age-associated changes in
   DNA methylation that was directionally consistent with those observed in
   humans. These findings lend further support to the notion that changes
   in DNA methylation are associated with chronological age and suggest
   that these processes are often conserved across tissues and between
   mammalian species. Our data highlight the relevance of utilizing model
   systems, in which environmental and genetic influences can be carefully
   controlled, for the further study of these phenomena. (C) 2016 The

Title = {Variation in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine across human cortex and cerebellum},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Background: The most widely utilized approaches for quantifying DNA
   methylation involve the treatment of genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite;
   however, this method cannot distinguish between 5-methylcytosine (5mC)
   and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Previous studies have shown that
   5hmC is enriched in the brain, although little is known about its
   genomic distribution and how it differs between anatomical regions and
   individuals. In this study, we combine oxidative bisulfite (oxBS)
   treatment with the Illumina Infinium 450K BeadArray to quantify
   genome-wide patterns of 5hmC in two distinct anatomical regions of the
   brain from multiple individuals.
   Results: We identify 37,145 and 65,563 sites passing our threshold for
   detectable 5hmC in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum respectively,
   with 23,445 loci common across both brain regions. Distinct patterns of
   5hmC are identified in each brain region, with notable differences in
   the genomic location of the most hydroxymethylated loci between these
   brain regions. Tissue-specific patterns of 5hmC are subsequently
   confirmed in an independent set of prefrontal cortex and cerebellum
   samples.
   Conclusions: This study represents the first systematic analysis of 5hmC
   in the human brain, identifying tissue-specific hydroxymethylated
   positions and genomic regions characterized by inter-individual
   variation in DNA hydroxymethylation. This study demonstrates the utility
   of combining oxBS-treatment with the Illumina 450k methylation array to
   systematically quantify 5hmC across the genome and the potential utility
   of this approach for epigenomic studies of brain disorders.},

Title = {Genetic variants near MLST8 and DHX57 affect the epigenetic age of the
   cerebellum},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {DNA methylation (DNAm) levels lend themselves for defining an epigenetic
   biomarker of aging known as the `epigenetic clock'. Our genome-wide
   association study (GWAS) of cerebellar epigenetic age acceleration
   identifies five significant (P<5.0 x 10(-8)) SNPs in two loci: 2p22.1
   (inside gene DHX57) and 16p13.3 near gene MLST8 (a subunit of mTOR
   complex 1 and 2). We find that the SNP in 16p13.3 has a cis-acting
   effect on the expression levels of MLST8 (P = 6.9 x 10(-18)) in most
   brain regions. In cerebellar samples, the SNP in 2p22.1 has a cis-effect
   on DHX57 (P = 4.4 x 10(-5)). Gene sets found by our GWAS analysis of
   cerebellar age acceleration exhibit significant overlap with those of
   Alzheimer's disease (P = 4.4 x 10(-15)), age-related macular
   degeneration (P = 6.4 x 10(-6)), and Parkinson's disease (P = 2.6 x
   10(-4)). Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of a new paradigm
   for understanding aging and age-related diseases: it will be fruitful to
   use epigenetic tissue age as endophenotype in GWAS.},

Abstract = {Prenatal maternal stress exposure has been associated with neonatal
   differential DNA methylation. However, the available evidence in humans
   is largely based on candidate gene methylation studies, where only a few
   CpG sites were evaluated. The aim of this study was to examine the
   association between prenatal exposure to maternal stress and offspring
   genome-wide cord blood methylation using different methods. First, we
   conducted a meta-analysis and follow-up pathway analyses. Second, we
   used novel region discovery methods {[}i.e., differentially methylated
   regions (DMRs) analyses]. To this end, we used data from two independent
   population-based studies, the Generation R Study (n = 912) and the Avon
   Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, n = 828), to (i)
   measure genome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood and (ii) extract a
   prenatal maternal stress composite. The meta-analysis (n(total) = 1,740)
   revealed no epigenome-wide (meta P <1.00e-07) associations of prenatal
   maternal stress exposure with neonatal differential DNA methylation.
   Follow-up analyses of the top hits derived from our epigenome-wide
   meta-analysis (meta P <1.00e-04) indicated an over-representation of the
   methyltransferase activity pathway. We identified no
   Bonferroni-corrected (P <1.00e-06) DMRs associated with prenatal
   maternal stress exposure. Combining data from two independent
   population-based samples in an epigenome-wide meta-analysis, the current
   study indicates that there are no large effects of prenatal maternal
   stress exposure on neonatal DNA methylation. Such replication efforts
   are essential in the search for robust associations, whether derived
   from candidate gene methylation or epigenome-wide studies.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPeripheral epigenetic marks hold promise for understanding
   psychiatric illness and may represent fingerprints of gene-environment
   interactions. We conducted an initial examination of CpG methylation
   variation in children with or without attention-deficit/hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD).
   MethodsChildren age 7-12 were recruited, screened, evaluated and
   assigned to ADHD or non-ADHD groups by defined research criteria. Two
   independent age-matched samples were examined, a discovery set (n=92,
   all boys, half control, half ADHD) and a confirmation set (n=20, half
   ADHD, all boys). 5-methylcytosine levels were quantified in salivary DNA
   using the Illumina 450K HumanMethylation array. Genes for which multiple
   probes were nominally significant and had a beta difference of at least
   2\% were evaluated for biological relevance and prioritized for
   confirmation and sequence validation. Gene pathways were explored and
   described.
   ResultsTwo genes met the criteria for confirmation testing, VIPR2 and
   MYT1L; both had multiple probes meeting cutoffs and strong biological
   relevance. Probes on VIPR2 passed FDR correction in the confirmation set
   and were confirmed through bisulfite sequencing. Enrichment analysis
   suggested involvement of gene sets or pathways related to inflammatory
   processes and modulation of monoamine and cholinergic neurotransmission.
   ConclusionsAlthough it is unknown to what extent CpG methylation seen in
   peripheral tissue reflect transcriptomic changes in the brain, these
   initial results indicate that peripheral DNA methylation markers in ADHD
   may be promising and suggest targeted hypotheses for future study in
   larger samples.},

Volume = {11},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {While DNA methylation is usually thought to be symmetrical across both
   alleles, there are some notable exceptions. Genomic imprinting and X
   chromosome inactivation are two well-studied sources of allele-specific
   methylation (ASM), but recent research has indicated a more complex
   pattern in which genotypic variation can be associated with
   allelically-skewed DNA methylation in cis. Given the known heterogeneity
   of DNA methylation across tissues and cell types we explored inter- and
   intra-individual variation in ASM across several regions of the human
   brain and whole blood from multiple individuals. Consistent with
   previous studies, we find widespread ASM with > 4\% of the similar to
   220,000 loci interrogated showing evidence of allelically-skewed DNA
   methylation. We identify ASM flanking known imprinted regions, and show
   that ASM sites are enriched in DNase I hypersensitivity sites and often
   located in an extended genomic context of intermediate DNA methylation.
   We also detect examples of genotype-driven ASM, some of which are
   tissue-specific. These findings contribute to our understanding of the
   nature of differential DNA methylation across tissues and have important
   implications for genetic studies of complex disease. As a resource to
   the community, ASM patterns across each of the tissues studied are
   available in a searchable online database:

Abstract = {We characterized DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in a

   mQTLs were primarily cis-acting, enriched in regulatory chromatin
   domains and transcription factor binding sites, and showed substantial
   overlap with genetic variants that were also associated with gene
   expression in the brain. Using tissue from three distinct regions of the
   adult brain (prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum), we found that
   most fetal brain mQTLs were developmentally stable, although a subset
   was characterized by fetal-specific effects. Fetal brain mQTLs were
   enriched amongst risk loci identified in a recent large-scale
   genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia, a severe

Abstract = {Background and Aims: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are
   heterogeneous disorders with complex aetiology. Quantitative genetic
   studies suggest that only a small proportion of the disease variance
   observed in IBD is accounted for by genetic variation, indicating a
   potential role for differential epigenetic regulation in disease
   aetiology. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide DNA
   methylation changes specifically associated with ulcerative colitis
   (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD activity.
   Methods: DNA methylation was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells (PBMCs) from 149 IBD cases (61 UC, 88 CD) and 39 controls using
   the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Technical and functional
   validation was performed using pyrosequencing and the real-time
   polymerase chain reaction. Cross-tissue replication of the top
   differentially methylated positions (DMPs) was tested in colonic mucosa
   tissue samples obtained from paediatric IBD cases and controls.
   Results: A total of 3196 probes were differentially methylated between
   CD cases and controls, while 1481 probes were differentially methylated
   between UC cases and controls. There was considerable (45\%) overlap
   between UC and CD DMPs. The top-ranked IBD-associated PBMC
   differentially methylated region (promoter region of TRIM39-RPP2) was
   also significantly hypomethylated in colonic mucosa from paediatric UC
   patients. In addition, we confirmed TRAF6 hypermethylation using
   pyrosequencing and found reduced TRAF6 gene expression in PBMCs of IBD
   patients.
   Conclusions: Our data provide new insights into differential epigenetic
   regulation of genes and molecular pathways, which may contribute to the
   pathogenesis and activity of IBD.},

Title = {Methylomic markers of persistent childhood asthma: a longitudinal study
   of asthma-discordant monozygotic twins},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIGENETICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {Background: Asthma is the most common chronic inflammatory disorder in
   children. The aetiology of asthma pathology is complex and highly
   heterogeneous, involving the interplay between genetic and environmental
   risk factors that is hypothesized to involve epigenetic processes. Our
   aim was to explore whether methylomic variation in early childhood is
   associated with discordance for asthma symptoms within monozygotic (MZ)
   twin pairs recruited from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) longitudinal
   twin study. We also aimed to identify differences in DNA methylation
   that are associated with asthma that develops in childhood and persists
   into early adulthood as these may represent useful prognostic
   biomarkers.
   Results: We examined genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in buccal
   cell samples collected from 37 MZ twin pairs discordant for asthma at
   age 10. DNA methylation at individual CpG sites demonstrated significant
   variability within discordant MZ twin pairs with the top-ranked
   nominally significant differentially methylated position (DMP) located
   in the HGSNAT gene. We stratified our analysis by assessing DNA
   methylation differences in a sub-group of MZ twin pairs who remained
   persistently discordant for asthma at age 18. The top-ranked nominally
   significant DMP associated with persisting asthma is located in the
   vicinity of the HLX gene, which has been previously implicated in
   childhood asthma.
   Conclusions: We identified DNA methylation differences associated with
   childhood asthma in peripheral DNA samples from discordant MZ twin
   pairs. Our data suggest that differences in DNA methylation associated
   with childhood asthma which persists into early adulthood are distinct

Abstract = {Recent research on disparate psychiatric disorders has implicated rare
   variants in genes involved in global gene regulation and chromatin
   modification, as well as many common variants located primarily in
   regulatory regions of the genome. Understanding precisely how these
   variants contribute to disease will require a deeper appreciation for
   the mechanisms of gene regulation in the developing and adult human
   brain. The PsychENCODE project aims to produce a public resource of
   multidimensional genomic data using tissue- and cell type specific
   samples from approximately 1,000 phenotypically well-characterized,
   high-quality healthy and disease-affected human post-mortem brains, as
   well as functionally characterize disease-associated regulatory elements
   and variants in model systems. We are beginning with a focus on autism
   spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and expect that
   this knowledge will apply to a wide variety of psychiatric disorders.
   This paper outlines the motivation and design of PsychENCODE.},

Abstract = {Diurnal preference is an individual's preference for daily activities
   and sleep timing and is strongly correlated with the underlying
   circadian clock and the sleep-wake cycle validating its use as an
   indirect circadian measure in humans. Recent research has implicated DNA
   methylation as a mechanism involved in the regulation of the circadian
   clock system in humans and other mammals. In order to evaluate the
   extent of epigenetic differences associated with diurnal preference, we
   examined genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in DNA from monozygotic
   (MZ) twin-pairs discordant for diurnal preference. MZ twins were
   selected from a longitudinal twin study designed to investigate the
   interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the development of
   emotional and behavioral difficulties. Fifteen pairs of MZ twins were
   identified in which one member scored considerably higher on the
   Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) than the
   other. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were assessed in twins'
   buccal cell DNA using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450
   BeadChips. Quality control and data pre-processing was undertaken using
   the wateRmelon package. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were
   identified using an analysis strategy taking into account both the
   significance and the magnitude of DNA methylation differences. Our data
   indicate that DNA methylation differences are detectable in MZ twins
   discordant for diurnal preference. Moreover, downstream gene ontology
   (GO) enrichment analysis on the top-ranked diurnal preference associated
   DMPs revealed significant enrichment of pathways that have been
   previously associated with circadian rhythm regulation, including cell
   adhesion processes and calcium ion binding.},

Abstract = {Childhood psychotic symptoms are associated with increased rates of
   schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders, and suicide attempts in
   adulthood; thus, elucidating early risk indicators is crucial to target
   prevention efforts. There is considerable discordance for psychotic
   symptoms between monozygotic twins, indicating that child-specific
   non-genetic factors must be involved. Epigenetic processes may
   constitute one of these factors and have not yet been investigated in
   relation to childhood psychotic symptoms. Therefore, this study explored
   whether differences in DNA methylation at age 10 were associated with
   monozygotic twin discordance for psychotic symptoms at age 12. The
   Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study cohort of 2,232
   children (1,116 twin pairs) was assessed for age-12 psychotic symptoms
   and 24 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for symptoms were identified
   for methylomic comparison. Children provided buccal samples at ages 5
   and 10. DNA was bisulfite modified and DNA methylation was quantified
   using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. Differentially methylated
   positions (DMPs) associated with psychotic symptoms were subsequently
   tested in post-mortem prefrontal cortex tissue from adult schizophrenia
   patients and age-matched controls. Site-specific DNA methylation
   differences were observed at age 10 between monozygotic twins discordant
   for age-12 psychotic symptoms. Similar DMPs were not found at age 5. The
   top-ranked psychosis-associated DMP (cg23933044), located in the
   promoter of the C5ORF42 gene, was also hypomethylated in post-mortem
   prefrontal cortex brain tissue from schizophrenia patients compared to
   unaffected controls. These data tentatively suggest that epigenetic
   variation in peripheral tissue is associated with childhood psychotic
   symptoms and may indicate susceptibility to schizophrenia and other
   mental health problems.},

Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Given the tissue-specific nature of epigenetic processes, the assessment
   of disease-relevant tissue is an important consideration for
   epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Little is known about whether
   easily accessible tissues, such as whole blood, can be used to address
   questions about interindividual epigenomic variation in inaccessible
   tissues, such as the brain. We quantified DNA methylation in matched DNA
   samples isolated from whole blood and 4 brain regions (prefrontal
   cortex, entorhinal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum) from
   122 individuals. We explored co-variation between tissues and the extent
   to which methylomic variation in blood is predictive of interindividual
   variation identified in the brain. For the majority of DNA methylation
   sites, interindividual variation in whole blood is not a strong
   predictor of interindividual variation in the brain, although the
   relationship with cortical regions is stronger than with the cerebellum.
   Variation at a subset of probes is strongly correlated across tissues,
   even in instances when the actual level of DNA methylation is
   significantly different between them. A substantial proportion of this
   co-variation, however, is likely to result from genetic influences. Our
   data suggest that for the majority of the genome, a blood-based EWAS for
   disorders where brain is presumed to be the primary tissue of interest
   will give limited information relating to underlying pathological
   processes. These results do not, however, discount the utility of using
   a blood-based EWAS to identify biomarkers of disease phenotypes manifest
   in the brain. We have generated a searchable database for the
   interpretation of data from blood-based EWAS analyses
   (http://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/bloodbrain/).},

Abstract = {This paper presents multilevel findings on adolescents' victimization
   exposure from a large longitudinal cohort of twins. Data were obtained
   from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, an
   epidemiological study of 2,232 children (1,116 twin pairs) followed to
   18 years of age (with 93\% retention). To assess adolescent
   victimization, we combined best practices in survey research on
   victimization with optimal approaches to measuring life stress and
   traumatic experiences, and introduce a reliable system for coding
   severity of victimization. One in three children experienced at least
   one type of severe victimization during adolescence (crime
   victimization, peer/sibling victimization, Internet/mobile phone
   victimization, sexual victimization, family violence, maltreatment, or
   neglect), and most types of victimization were more prevalent among
   children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Exposure to multiple
   victimization types was common, as was revictimization; over half of
   those physically maltreated in childhood were also exposed to severe
   physical violence in adolescence. Biometric twin analyses revealed that
   environmental factors had the greatest influence on most types of
   victimization, while severe physical maltreatment from caregivers during
   adolescence was predominantly influenced by heritable factors. The
   findings from this study showcase how distinct levels of victimization
   measurement can be harmonized in large-scale studies of health and
   development.},

Abstract = {Given that many brain disorders are characterized by mitochondrial
   dysfunction, there is a growing interest in investigating genetic and
   epigenetic variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). One major caveat for
   such studies is the presence of nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes
   (NUMTs), which are regions of the mitochondrial genome that have been
   inserted into the nuclear genome over evolution and, if not accounted
   for, can confound genetic studies of mtDNA. Here we provide the first
   systematic comparison of methods for isolating mtDNA from frozen
   post-mortem human brain tissue. Our data show that a commercial method
   from Miltenyi Biotec, which magnetically isolates mitochondria using
   antibodies raised against the mitochondrial import receptor subunit
   TOM22, gives significant mtDNA enrichment and should be considered the
   method of choice for mtDNA studies in frozen brain tissue.},

Title = {Association of Protein Phosphatase PPM1G With Alcohol Use Disorder and
   Brain Activity During Behavioral Control in a Genome-Wide Methylation
   Analysis},

Abstract = {Objective: The genetic component of alcohol use disorder is substantial,
   but monozygotic twin discordance indicates a role for nonheritable
   differences that could be mediated by epigenetics. Despite growing
   evidence associating epigenetics and psychiatric disorders, it is
   unclear how epigenetics, particularly DNA methylation, relate to brain
   function and behavior, including drinking behavior.
   Method: The authors carried out a genome-wide analysis of DNA
   methylation of 18 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for alcohol use
   disorder and validated differentially methylated regions. After
   validation, the authors characterized these differentially methylated
   regions using personality trait assessment and functional MRI in a
   sample of 499 adolescents.
   Results: Hypermethylation in the 3'-protein-phosphatase-1G (PPM1G) gene
   locus was associated with alcohol use disorder. The authors found
   association of PPM1G hypermethylation with early escalation of alcohol
   use and increased impulsiveness. They also observed association of PPM1G
   hypermethylation with increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent response in
   the right subthalamic nucleus during an impulsiveness task.
   Conclusions: Overall, the authors provide first evidence for an
   epigenetic marker associated with alcohol consumption and its underlying
   neurobehavioral phenotype.},

Title = {Blood methylomic signatures of presymptomatic dementia in elderly

Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Due to an aging population, the incidence of dementia is steadily
   rising. The ability to identify early markers in blood, which appear
   before the onset of clinical symptoms is of considerable interest to
   allow early intervention, particularly in ``high risk{''} groups such as
   those with type 2 diabetes. Here, we present a longitudinal study of
   genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood from 18 elderly individuals
   with type 2 diabetes who developed presymptomatic dementia within an
   18-month period following baseline assessment and 18 age-, sex-, and
   education-matched controls who maintained normal cognitive function. We
   identified a significant overlap in methylomic differences between
   groups at baseline and follow-up, with 8 CpG sites being consistently
   differentially methylated above our nominal significance threshold
   before symptoms at baseline and at 18 months follow up, after a
   diagnosis of presymptomatic dementia. Finally, we report a significant
   overlap between DNA methylation differences identified in converters,
   only after they develop symptoms of dementia, with differences at the
   same loci in blood samples from patients with clinically diagnosed
   Alzheimer's disease compared with unaffected control subjects. (C) 2015

Title = {Methylomic trajectories across human fetal brain development},
Journal = {GENOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {338-352},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Epigenetic processes play a key role in orchestrating transcriptional
   regulation during development. The importance of DNA methylation in
   fetal brain development is highlighted by the dynamic expression of de
   novo DNA methyl-transferases during the perinatal period and
   neurodevelopmental deficits associated with mutations in the methyl-CpG
   binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. However, our knowledge about the
   temporal changes to the epigenome during fetal brain development has, to
   date, been limited. We quantified genome-wide patterns of DNA
   methylation at similar to 400,000 sites in 179 human fetal brain samples
   (100 male, 79 female) spanning 23 to 184 d post-conception. We
   identified highly significant changes in DNA methylation across fetal
   brain development at >7\% of sites, with an enrichment of loci becoming
   hypomethylated with fetal age. Sites associated with developmental
   changes in DNA methylation during fetal brain development were
   significantly underrepresented in promoter regulatory regions but
   significantly overrepresented in regions flanking CpG islands (shores
   and shelves) and gene bodies. Highly significant differences in DNA
   methylation were observed between males and females at a number of
   autosomal sites, with a small number of regions showing sex-specific DNA
   methylation trajectories across brain development. Weighted gene
   comethylation network analysis (WGCNA) revealed discrete modules of
   comethylated loci associated with fetal age that are significantly
   enriched for genes involved in neurodevelopmental processes. This is, to
   our knowledge, the most extensive study of DNA methylation across human
   fetal brain development to date, confirming the prenatal period as a
   time of considerable epigenomic plasticity.},

Title = {Intermediate DNA methylation is a conserved signature of genome
   regulation},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The role of intermediate methylation states in DNA is unclear. Here, to
   comprehensively identify regions of intermediate methylation and their
   quantitative relationship with gene activity, we apply integrative and
   comparative epigenomics to 25 human primary cell and tissue samples. We
   report 18,452 intermediate methylation regions located near 36\% of
   genes and enriched at enhancers, exons and DNase I hypersensitivity
   sites. Intermediate methylation regions average 57\% methylation, are
   predominantly allele-independent and are conserved across individuals
   and between mouse and human, suggesting a conserved function. These
   regions have an intermediate level of active chromatin marks and their
   associated genes have intermediate transcriptional activity. Exonic
   intermediate methylation correlates with exon inclusion at a level
   between that of fully methylated and unmethylated exons, highlighting
   gene context-dependent functions. We conclude that intermediate DNA
   methylation is a conserved signature of gene regulation and exon usage.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibits numerous clinical
   and molecular features that are consistent with putative epigenetic
   misregulation. Despite growing interest in epigenetic studies of
   psychiatric diseases, the methodologies guiding such studies have not
   been well defined.
   METHODS: We performed DNA modification analysis in white blood cells
   from monozygotic twins discordant for MDD, in brain prefrontal cortex,
   and germline (sperm) samples from affected individuals and control
   subjects (total N = 304) using 8.1K CpG island microarrays and fine
   mapping. In addition to the traditional locus-by-locus comparisons, we
   explored the potential of new analytical approaches in epigenomic
   studies.
   RESULTS: In the microarray experiment, we detected a number of nominally
   significant DNA modification differences in MDD and validated selected
   targets using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Some MDD epigenetic changes,
   however, overlapped across brain, blood, and sperm more often than
   expected by chance. We also demonstrated that stratification for disease
   severity and age may increase the statistical power of epimutation
   detection. Finally, a series of new analytical approaches, such as DNA
   modification networks and machine-learning algorithms using binary and
   quantitative depression phenotypes, provided additional insights on the
   epigenetic contributions to MDD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mapping epigenetic differences in MDD (and other
   psychiatric diseases) is a complex task. However, combining traditional
   and innovative analytical strategies may lead to identification of
   disease-specific etiopathogenic epimutations.},

Title = {Genome-wide Methylomic Analysis of Monozygotic Twins Discordant for

Abstract = {Background: Adolescent depression is a common neuropsychiatric disorder
   that often continues into adulthood and is associated with a wide range
   of poor outcomes including suicide. Although numerous studies have
   looked at genetic markers associated with depression, the role of
   epigenetic variation remains relatively unexplored.
   Methods: Monozygotic (MZ) twins were selected from an adolescent twin
   study designed to investigate the interplay of genetic and environmental
   factors in the development of emotional and behavioral difficulties.
   There were 18 pairs of MZ twins identified in which one member scored
   consistently higher (group mean within the clinically significant range)
   on self-rated depression than the other. We assessed genome-wide
   patterns of DNA methylation in twin buccal cell DNA using the Infinium
   HumanMethylation450 BeadChip from Illumina. Quality control and data
   preprocessing was undertaken using the wateRmelon package.
   Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using an
   analysis strategy taking into account both the significance and the
   magnitude of DNA methylation differences. The top differentially
   methylated DMP was successfully validated by bisulfite-pyrosequencing,
   and identified DMPs were tested in postmortem brain samples obtained
   from patients with major depressive disorder (n = 14) and matched
   control subjects (n = 15).
   Results: Two reproducible depression-associated DMPs were identified,
   including the top-ranked DMP that was located within STK32C, which
   encodes a serine/threonine kinase, of unknown function.
   Conclusions: Our data indicate that DNA methylation differences are
   apparent in MZ twins discordant for adolescent depression and that some
   of the disease-associated variation observed in buccal cell DNA is
   mirrored in adult brain tissue obtained from individuals with clinical
   depression.},

Abstract = {We used a collection of 708 prospectively collected autopsied brains to
   assess the methylation state of the brain's DNA in relation to
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that the level of methylation at 71
   of the 415,848 interrogated CpGs was significantly associated with the
   burden of AD pathology, including CpGs in the ABCA7 and BIN1 regions,
   which harbor known AD susceptibility variants. We validated 11 of the
   differentially methylated regions in an independent set of 117 subjects.
   Furthermore, we functionally validated these CpG associations and
   identified the nearby genes whose RNA expression was altered in AD:
   ANK1, CDH23, DIP2A, RHBDF2, RPL13, SERPINF1 and SERPINF2. Our analyses
   suggest that these DNA methylation changes may have a role in the onset
   of AD given that we observed them in presymptomatic subjects and that
   six of the validated genes connect to a known AD susceptibility gene
   network.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is
   characterized by progressive neuropathology and cognitive decline. We
   performed a cross-tissue analysis of methylomic variation in AD using
   samples from four independent human post-mortem brain cohorts. We
   identified a differentially methylated region in the ankyrin 1 (ANK1)
   gene that was associated with neuropathology in the entorhinal cortex, a
   primary site of AD manifestation. This region was confirmed as being
   substantially hypermethylated in two other cortical regions (superior
   temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex), but not in the cerebellum, a
   region largely protected from neurodegeneration in AD, or whole blood
   obtained pre-mortem from the same individuals. Neuropathology-associated
   ANK1 hypermethylation was subsequently confirmed in cortical samples
   from three independent brain cohorts. This study represents, to the best
   of our knowledge, the first epigenome-wide association study of AD
   employing a sequential replication design across multiple tissues and
   highlights the power of this approach for identifying methylomic
   variation associated with complex disease.},

Abstract = {Epigenetic processes play a key role in the central nervous system and
   altered levels of 5-methylcytosine have been associated with a number of
   neurologic phenotypes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, 3
   additional cytosine modifications have been identified
   (5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine),
   which are thought to be intermediate steps in the demethylation of
   5-methylcytosine to unmodified cytosine. Little is known about the
   frequency of these modifications in the human brain during health or
   disease. In this study, we used immunofluorescence to confirm the
   presence of each modification in human brain and investigate their
   cross-tissue abundance in AD patients and elderly control samples. We
   identify a significant AD-associated decrease in global
   5-hydroxymethylcytosine in entorhinal cortex and cerebellum, and
   differences in 5-formylcytosine levels between brain regions. Our study
   further implicates a role for epigenetic alterations in AD. (C) 2014

   Alzheimer's disease},
Journal = {MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Experimental evidence has demonstrated that several aspects of adult
   neural stem cells (NSCs), including their quiescence, proliferation,
   fate specification and differentiation, are regulated by epigenetic
   mechanisms. These control the expression of specific sets of genes,
   often including those encoding for small non-coding RNAs, indicating a
   complex interplay between various epigenetic factors and cellular
   functions.
   Previous studies had indicated that in addition to the neuropathology in
   Alzheimer's disease (AD), plasticity-related changes are observed in
   brain areas with ongoing neurogenesis, like the hippocampus and
   subventricular zone. Given the role of stem cells e. g. in hippocampal
   functions like cognition, and given their potential for brain repair, we
   here review the epigenetic mechanisms relevant for NSCs and AD etiology.
   Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the epigenetic
   regulation of adult NSCs will advance our knowledge on the role of adult
   neurogenesis in degeneration and possibly regeneration in the AD brain.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder
   involving dysregulation of many biological pathways at multiple levels.
   Classical epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone
   modifications, and regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs), are among the major
   regulatory elements that control these pathways at the molecular level,
   with epigenetic modifications regulating gene expression
   transcriptionally and miRNAs suppressing gene expression
   posttranscriptionally. Epigenetic mechanisms and miRNAs have recently
   been shown to closely interact with each other, thereby creating
   reciprocal regulatory circuits, which appear to be disrupted in neuronal
   and glial cells affected by AD. Here, we review those miRNAs implicated
   in AD that are regulated by promoter DNA methylation and/or chromatin
   modifications and, which frequently direct the expression of
   constituents of the epigenetic machinery, concluding with the
   delineation of a complex epigenetic-miRNA regulatory network and its
   alterations in AD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common sex-chromosome aneuploidy
   in humans. Most affected individuals carry one extra X-chromosome
   (47,XXY karyotype) and the condition presents with a heterogeneous mix
   of reproductive, physical and psychiatric phenotypes. Although the
   mechanism(s) by which the supernumerary X-chromosome determines these
   features of KS are poorly understood, skewed X-chromosome inactivation
   (XCI), gene-dosage dysregulation, and the parental origin of the extra
   X-chromosome have all been implicated, suggesting an important role for
   epigenetic processes. We assessed genomic, methylomic and transcriptomic
   variation in matched prefrontal cortex and cerebellum samples
   identifying an individual with a 47,XXY karyotype who was comorbid for
   schizophrenia and had a notably reduced cerebellum mass compared with
   other individuals in the study (n = 49). We examined methylomic and
   transcriptomic differences in this individual relative to female and
   male samples with 46,XX or 46,XY karyotypes, respectively, and
   identified numerous locus-specific differences in DNA methylation and
   gene expression, with many differences being autosomal and
   tissue-specific. Furthermore, global DNA methylation, assessed via the
   interrogation of LINE-1 and Alu repetitive elements, was significantly
   altered in the 47,XXY patient in a tissue-specific manner with extreme
   hypomethylation detected in the prefrontal cortex and extreme
   hypermethylation in the cerebellum. This study provides the first
   detailed molecular characterization of the prefrontal cortex and
   cerebellum from an individual with a 47,XXY karyotype, identifying
   widespread tissue-specific epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in
   the brain.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR AUTISM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Background: Advanced paternal age is robustly associated with several
   human neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly autism. The precise
   mechanism(s) mediating the paternal age effect are not known, but they
   are thought to involve the accumulation of de novo (epi)genomic
   alterations. In this study we investigate differences in the frontal
   cortex transcriptome in a mouse model of advanced paternal age.
   Findings: Transcriptomic profiling was undertaken for medial prefrontal
   cortex tissue dissected from the male offspring of young fathers (2
   month old, 4 sires, n = 16 offspring) and old fathers (10 month old, 6
   sires, n = 16 offspring) in a mouse model of advancing paternal age. We
   found a number of differentially expressed genes in the offspring of
   older fathers, many previously implicated in the aetiology of autism.
   Pathway analysis highlighted significant enrichment for changes in
   functional networks involved in inflammation and inflammatory disease,
   which are also implicated in autism.
   Conclusions: We observed widespread alterations to the transcriptome
   associated with advanced paternal age with an enrichment of genes
   associated with inflammation, an interesting observation given previous
   evidence linking the immune system to several neuropsychiatric disorders
   including autism.},

Abstract = {Gestational exposure to environmental toxins such as nicotine may result
   in detectable gene expression changes in later life. To investigate the
   direct toxic effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on later brain
   development, we have used transcriptomic analysis of striatal samples to
   identify gene expression differences between adolescent Lister Hooded
   rats exposed to nicotine in utero and controls. Using an additional
   group of animals matched for the reduced food intake experienced in the
   nicotine group, we were also able to assess the impact of imposed
   food-restriction on gene expression profiles. We found little evidence
   for a role of gestational nicotine exposure on altered gene expression
   in the striatum of adolescent offspring at a significance level of
   p<0.01 and | log2 fold change >0.5|, although we cannot exclude the
   possibility of nicotine-induced changes in other brain regions, or at
   other time points. We did, however, find marked gene expression
   differences in response to imposed food-restriction. Food-restriction
   resulted in significant group differences for a number of immediate
   early genes (IEGs) including Fos, Fosb, Fosl2, Arc, Junb, Nr4a1 and
   Nr4a3. These genes are associated with stress response pathways and
   therefore may reflect long-term effects of nutritional deprivation on

Title = {Hypermethylation in the ZBTB20 gene is associated with major depressive
   disorder},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Background: Although genetic variation is believed to contribute to an
   individual's susceptibility to major depressive disorder, genome-wide
   association studies have not yet identified associations that could
   explain the full etiology of the disease. Epigenetics is increasingly
   believed to play a major role in the development of common clinical
   phenotypes, including major depressive disorder.
   Results: Genome-wide MeDIP-Sequencing was carried out on a total of 50
   monozygotic twin pairs from the UK and Australia that are discordant for
   depression. We show that major depressive disorder is associated with
   significant hypermethylation within the coding region of ZBTB20, and is
   replicated in an independent cohort of 356 unrelated case-control
   individuals. The twins with major depressive disorder also show
   increased global variation in methylation in comparison with their
   unaffected co-twins. ZBTB20 plays an essential role in the specification
   of the Cornu Ammonis-1 field identity in the developing hippocampus, a
   region previously implicated in the development of major depressive
   disorder.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that aberrant methylation profiles
   affecting the hippocampus are associated with major depressive disorder
   and show the potential of the epigenetic twin model in neuro-psychiatric
   disease.},

Abstract = {Considerable evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs
   early in Alzheimer's disease, both in affected brain regions and in
   leukocytes, potentially precipitating neurodegeneration through
   increased oxidative stress. Epigenetic processes are emerging as a
   dynamic mechanism through which environmental signals may contribute to
   cellular changes, leading to neuropathology and disease. Until recently,
   little attention was given to the mitochondrial epigenome itself, as
   preliminary studies indicated an absence of DNA modifications. However,
   recent research has demonstrated that epigenetic changes to the
   mitochondrial genome do occur, potentially playing an important role in
   several disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. This
   review explores the potential role of mitochondrial epigenetic
   dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease etiology and discusses some technical
   issues pertinent to the study of these processes.},

Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},

Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder that is
   hypothesized to result from disturbances in early brain development.
   There is mounting evidence to support a role for developmentally
   regulated epigenetic variation in the molecular etiology of the
   disorder. Here, we describe a systematic study of
   schizophrenia-associated methylomic variation in the adult brain and its
   relationship to changes in DNA methylation across human fetal brain
   development.
   Results: We profile methylomic variation in matched prefrontal cortex
   and cerebellum brain tissue from schizophrenia patients and controls,
   identifying disease-associated differential DNA methylation at multiple
   loci, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, and confirming these
   differences in an independent set of adult brain samples. Our data
   reveal discrete modules of co-methylated loci associated with
   schizophrenia that are enriched for genes involved in neurodevelopmental
   processes and include loci implicated by genetic studies of the
   disorder. Methylomic data from human fetal cortex samples, spanning 23
   to 184 days post-conception, indicates that schizophrenia-associated
   differentially methylated positions are significantly enriched for loci
   at which DNA methylation is dynamically altered during human fetal brain
   development.
   Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that schizophrenia has an
   important early neurodevelopmental component, and suggest that
   epigenetic mechanisms may mediate these effects.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a sporadic, chronic neurodegenerative
   disease, usually occurring late in life. The last decade has witnessed
   tremendous advances in our understanding about the genetic basis of AD,
   but a large amount of the variance in disease risk remains to be
   explained. Epigenetic mechanisms, which developmentally regulate gene
   expression via modifications to DNA, histone proteins, and chromatin,
   have been hypothesized to play a role in other complex neurobiological
   diseases, and studies to identify genome-wide epigenetic changes in AD
   are currently under way. However, the simple brute-force approach that
   has been successfully employed in genome-wide association studies is
   unlikely to be successful in epigenome-wide association studies of
   neurodegeneration. A more academic approach to understanding the role of
   epigenetic variation in AD is required, with careful consideration of
   study design, methodological approaches, tissue-specificity, and causal
   inference. In this article, we review the empirical literature
   supporting a role for epigenetic processes in AD, and discuss important
   considerations and future directions for this new and emerging field of
   research. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {A data-driven approach to preprocessing Illumina 450K methylation array
   data},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Background: As the most stable and experimentally accessible epigenetic
   mark, DNA methylation is of great interest to the research community.
   The landscape of DNA methylation across tissues, through development and
   in disease pathogenesis is not yet well characterized. Thus there is a
   need for rapid and cost effective methods for assessing genome-wide
   levels of DNA methylation. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450
   (450K) BeadChip is a very useful addition to the available methods for
   DNA methylation analysis but its complex design, incorporating two
   different assay methods, requires careful consideration. Accordingly,
   several normalization schemes have been published. We have taken
   advantage of known DNA methylation patterns associated with genomic
   imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in addition to the
   performance of SNP genotyping assays present on the array, to derive
   three independent metrics which we use to test alternative schemes of
   correction and normalization. These metrics also have potential utility
   as quality scores for datasets.
   Results: The standard index of DNA methylation at any specific CpG site
   is beta = M/(M + U + 100) where M and U are methylated and unmethylated
   signal intensities, respectively. Betas (beta s) calculated from raw
   signal intensities (the default GenomeStudio behavior) perform well, but
   using 11 methylomic datasets we demonstrate that quantile normalization
   methods produce marked improvement, even in highly consistent data, by
   all three metrics. The commonly used procedure of normalizing betas is
   inferior to the separate normalization of M and U, and it is also
   advantageous to normalize Type I and Type II assays separately. More
   elaborate manipulation of quantiles proves to be counterproductive.
   Conclusions: Careful selection of preprocessing steps can minimize
   variance and thus improve statistical power, especially for the
   detection of the small absolute DNA methylation changes likely
   associated with complex disease phenotypes. For the convenience of the
   research community we have created a user-friendly R software package
   called wateRmelon, downloadable from bioConductor, compatible with the
   existing methylumi, minfi and IMA packages, that allows others to
   utilize the same normalization methods and data quality tests on 450K
   data.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR BRAIN},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Background: Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) is a paternally
   expressed imprinted gene regulating fetal growth, playing an integral
   role in the development of many tissues including the brain. The
   parent-of-origin specific expression of Igf2 is largely controlled by
   allele-specific DNA methylation at CTCF-binding sites in the imprinting
   control region (ICR), located immediately upstream of the neighboring
   H19 gene. Previously we reported evidence of a negative correlation
   between DNA methylation in this region and cerebellum weight in humans.
   Results: We quantified cerebellar DNA methylation across all four CTCF
   binding sites spanning the murine Igf2/H19 ICR in an outbred population
   of Heterogeneous Stock (HS) mice (n = 48). We observe that DNA
   methylation at the second and third CTCF binding sites in the Igf2/H19
   ICR shows a negative relationship with cerebellar mass, reflecting the
   association observed in human post-mortem cerebellum tissue.
   Conclusions: Given the important role of the cerebellum in motor control
   and cognition, and the link between structural cerebellar abnormalities
   and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, the identification of epigenetic
   factors associated with cerebellum growth and development may provide
   important insights about the etiology of psychiatric disorders.},

Abstract = {Recent multi-dimensional approaches to the study of complex disease have
   revealed powerful insights into how genetic and epigenetic factors may
   underlie their aetiopathogenesis. We examined genotype-epigenotype
   interactions in the context of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), focussing on known
   regions of genomic susceptibility. We assayed DNA methylation in 60
   females, stratified according to disease susceptibility haplotype using
   previously identified association loci. CpG methylation was assessed
   using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on a targeted array
   (MeDIP-chip) and absolute methylation values were estimated using a
   Bayesian algorithm (BATMAN). Absolute methylation levels were quantified
   across LD blocks, and we identified increased DNA methylation on the FTO
   obesity susceptibility haplotype, tagged by the rs8050136 risk allele A
   (p = 9.40 x 10(-4), permutation p = 1.0 x 10(-3)). Further analysis
   across the 46 kb LD block using sliding windows localised the most
   significant difference to be within a 7.7 kb region (p = 1.13 x 10(-7)).
   Sequence level analysis, followed by pyrosequencing validation, revealed
   that the methylation difference was driven by the co-ordinated phase of
   CpG-creating SNPs across the risk haplotype. This 7.7 kb region of
   haplotype-specific methylation (HSM), encapsulates a Highly Conserved
   Non-Coding Element (HCNE) that has previously been validated as a
   long-range enhancer, supported by the histone H3K4me1 enhancer
   signature. This study demonstrates that integration of Genome-Wide
   Association (GWA) SNP and epigenomic DNA methylation data can identify
   potential novel genotype-epigenotype interactions within
   disease-associated loci, thus providing a novel route to aid unravelling
   common complex diseases.},
